What is the worst symptom of   <START:problem>   allergies   <END>    ?   <START:treatment>   The histamine   <END>   then acts on   <START:test>   the eyes , nose , throat , lungs   <END>    ,    <START:problem>  skin   <END>   , or    <START:problem>  gastrointestinal tract and causes the symptoms    <END>   of    <START:problem>  the allergic reaction   <END>   .   <START:test>  Future exposure  <END>    to that same allergen will trigger this antibody response again . This means that every time you come into contact with that allergen , you 'll have   <START:problem>  an allergic reaction  <END>   .   <START:problem>  allergic reactions  <END>   can be mild , like   <START:problem>  a runny nose  <END>   , or they can be severe , like   <START:problem>  difficulty breathing  <END>   .   <START:problem>  An asthma attack  <END>   , for example , is often an allergic reaction to something that is breathed into the lungs by a person who is susceptible .

SURGEON : John Doe , DPM DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic manner and injected with  <START:treatment>  lidocaine  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  preoperatively .  <START:treatment>  Martin bandage  <END>  was used to exsanguinate the foot . Ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg of  <START:treatment>  pressure to control hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Classic dorsomedial incision  <END>  was made over the first ray , starting at the base of the distal phalanx and extending onto the first metatarsal cuneiform joint area .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was deepened and  <START:problem>  bleeding vessels  <END>  were bovied . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down to the capsular structures . Soft tissue was reflected medial and lateral , exposing the capsular structures of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanx .  <START:problem>  Standard classic incision  <END>  was then made through the capsule with  <START:problem>  a small portion of the capsule  <END>  being excised over the dorsomedial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint . Capsular structures were then undermined and reflected medially and laterally , exposing the first  <START:problem>  metatarsal head , neck and shaft region  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the proximal phalanx in its entirety  <END>  . Care was taken to preserve the lateral components of  <START:problem>  the first metatarsal interspace  <END>  and the vascular attachments to the head of the first metatarsal . The first interspace was not explored .  <START:problem>  An undermining  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  a lateral release  <END>  were performed through the bottom of the first metatarsophalangeal joint , cutting the collateral ligaments on the sesamoid apparatus and the lateral capsule , allowing the tibial and fibular sesamoid to be rotated and pulled back medially .
Attention was then directed to  <START:problem>  the first metatarsal head  <END>  . Medial eminence was cut and remodeled using a sagittal saw and  <START:problem>  a rotary bur  <END>  , at which time the high intermetatarsal angle was addressed using the  <START:problem>  FRS system  <END>  and performing  <START:problem>  a Z-osteotomy  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a K-wire oriented slightly dorsal third  <END>  , and it was angulated slightly distally from the medial aspect to the more distal lateral aspect slightly beyond the perpendicular to the first metatarsal itself . The second K-wire was oriented proximal plantar and near the base of  <START:problem>  the first metatarsal  <END>  , and this was angulated and placed perpendicular to the second metatarsal .  <START:problem>  Both K-wires  <END>  were angulated from dorsomedial to plantar lateral to allow for plantar flexion of the first metatarsal .  <START:treatment>  The osteotomy guide  <END>  was then introduced to facilitate the cut . A longitudinal arm was made and then the dorsal distal wing of  <START:test>  the osteotomy  <END>  was performed and the plantar proximal wing was performed .
Upon completion , the capital fragment was easily shifted laterally , reducing the intermetatarsal angle , with plantar flexion reducing the elevatus and the base was rotated preserving the proximal articular set angle and alignment . It was held in place with  <START:treatment>  the FRS offset bone clamp  <END>  and then 3 K-wires were then introduced for  <START:treatment>  the FRS screw system  <END>  , one running from proximal dorsal to distal plantar into the head of the first metatarsal but not through the metatarsal . The second ones were made from dorsal to plantar , proximal to the first , and did go through the cortex on the top and on the bottom .  <START:treatment>  Three FRS screws  <END>  were used .  <START:problem>  Excellent compression  <END>  was achieved .  <START:test>  The K-wires  <END>  were removed , also  <START:treatment>  the bone clamp  <END>  was removed . Throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the Fluoroscan  <END>  was used for  <START:test>  checking alignment  <END>  and positioning of the sesamoids .
We had good alignment , good positioning and good range of motion . It was noted that the first metatarsal had a fair amount of erosion running along the groove , where the base of the proximal phalanx had been rubbing across the cartilage surface and eroded the cartilage down to a pink raw tissue on the cartilage , creating early  <START:problem>  degenerative joint disease  <END>  in that region . Once the positioning had taken place , the proximal phalanx was functioning better in the proper anatomical position and should prevent  <START:problem>  further degenerative joint disease  <END>  from occurring in the future . The foot was loaded . It was still noted that the intermetatarsal angle was in good position .  <START:problem>  Tibial sesamoid  <END>  was in excellent position , but there was still a fair amount of interphalangeus and still  <START:treatment>  an Akin osteotomy  <END>  was elected to be performed .
 <START:treatment>  Akin osteotomy  <END>  was then performed with base distal medial and the apex proximal lateral and completed  <START:treatment>  osteotomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a wedge of bone resected  <END>  . This was then feathered and the interphalangeus was then made into the proper position . Once it was felt adequate feathering had been performed , it was held in place with  <START:treatment>  the bone clamp  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  then 2 FRS screws  <END>  were introduced from medial to lateral , which allowed for  <START:problem>  compression of the osteotomy site  <END>  and good stabilization . At this time ,  <START:problem>  all bleeding vessels  <END>  were checked and bovied . The area was copiously flushed . Rotary bur was used to make all area that was sharp or irritating smooth and properly contoured . The foot was loaded . We had excellent range of motion , good positioning and again this was checked periodically with the Fluoroscan . The area was copiously flushed and then standard closure of capsule structures with 2-0 Dexon , subcutaneous with 3-0 Dexon and skin was then closed with  <START:treatment>  staples  <END>  .
Attention was then directed to the second metatarsal .  <START:problem>  A linear incision  <END>  was made over the dorsal aspect of  <START:test>  the second metatarsal head and neck region  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was deepened . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down to the periosteal structures .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was made through the periosteum medial to the extensor tendon apparatus . Capsular structures reflected  <START:test>  medial and laterally , exposing the head and neck of the second metatarsal  <END>  . Standard dorsal distal to plantar  <START:treatment>  proximal osteotomy  <END>  was performed . Once completed , the capital fragment was shifted proximally reducing the overall length . It was then held in placed with  <START:treatment>  a bone clamp  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  FRS  <END>  screw was utilized to  <START:treatment>  compress  <END>  and hold the osteotomy stable . The area was copiously flushed . Capsular structures were then closed with 3-0 Dexon and skin was closed with 4-0 nylon .

Attention was then directed to the fourth and fifth toes .  <START:problem>  A longitudinal incision  <END>  was made over the dorsolateral aspect of the fourth toe . The skin and soft tissue were reflected laterally . Capsular structure was then incised following  <START:problem>  the initial skin incision  <END>  , and the capsular structures were reflected as they envelope laterally and  <START:problem>  slightly dorsomedially  <END>  , exposing the lateral half of the head of the proximal phalanx , shaft of the proximal phalanx and middle phalanx of the fourth toe . Sagittal saw was introduced and  <START:problem>  the head on the lateral aspect  <END>  was cut and removed from the surgical site .  <START:problem>  The middle phalanx lateral half  <END>  was cut and removed from the surgical site . The remaining areas were then made smooth with  <START:treatment>  a rotary bur  <END>  . The area was copiously flushed . Capsular structure was closed with 4-0 Dexon and skin was then closed with 4-0 nylon .

Attention was then directed to the fifth toe .  <START:problem>  Two converging semi-elliptical incisions  <END>  were made over the corn / callus formation on the medial aspect of the distal interphalangeal joint .  <START:treatment>  Incisions  <END>  were deepened and enclosed piece of  <START:treatment>  skin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  corn  <END>  / callus formation were excised from the surgical site . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried over the distal interphalangeal joint .  <START:treatment>  A rotary bur  <END>  was introduced and the bony spurs noted on the medial aspect of the distal phalanx and on the middle phalanx were remodeled and removed with  <START:treatment>  rotary bur  <END>  . The areas were made smooth with rotary bur , copiously flushed and then standard closure of the skin and capsular structures with 4-0 nylon was accomplished .

At this time ,  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  was introduced into  <START:treatment>  all surgical sites  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  a long postoperative anesthesia  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Decadron  <END>  was then inserted into the joints of the distal interphalangeal joint of the fifth toe of left foot , into the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth toe of left foot . It was injected into the second metatarsophalangeal joint and injected into the first metatarsophalangeal joint and around  <START:problem>  the Akin osteotomy site  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  first metatarsal osteotomy  <END>  site to reduce  <START:problem>  postoperative inflammation  <END>  and reduce  <START:problem>  postoperative swelling  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  ointment  <START:treatment>  compressive dressing  <END>  was applied .  <START:treatment>  Tourniquet  <END>  was released .  <START:treatment>  CFT  <END>  was normal to all 5 digits on the left foot . After  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  , prior to bandaging ,  <START:treatment>  the foot  <END>  was loaded , range of motion was tested , alignment was checked and we had a good overall appearance . <START:test>  The extensor brevis tendon  <END>  was cut prior to closure on the first ray to prevent  <START:problem>  abductory pull  <END>  , and  <START:test>  overall cosmetic alignment  <END>  was excellent .  <START:problem>  Fluoroscan pictures  <END>  looked good and the patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedures  <END>  well .  <START:treatment>  A BK cast  <END>  with walking heel was applied in the operative room . The patient left the operating room in good condition .

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient presented with a history of  <START:problem>  being unable to retract the foreskin  <END>  .  <START:test>  Examination  <END>  showed  <START:problem>  clear-cut phimosis  <END>  . The opening into the foreskin was extremely tight and it could not be retracted over the glans . The foreskin itself appeared pale , scarred and thickened consistent with  <START:problem>  balanitis xerotica obliterans  <END>  . We discussed  <START:treatment>  treatment options  <END>  , but the patient has little choice but to go with  <START:treatment>  circumcision  <END>  . Explained to the patient that  <START:treatment>  circumcision  <END>  in adult males is  <START:problem>  quite painful  <END>  and has a very prolonged recovery . He understood and provided informed consent .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position .  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  was administered via  <START:problem>  LMA  <END>  . The genitalia were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . The foreskin was white and scarred , creating  <START:problem>  a tight phimosis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Two straight clamps  <END>  were placed at the 12 and 6 o'clock positions , approximately  <START:problem>  1 cm in depth along the foreskin  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The tissue between the jaws of the clamps  <END>  was crushed for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . The clamps were then removed and heavy scissors used to cut the foreskin at the 6 and 12 o'clock positions . At that point , the foreskin had been liberated enough to retract over the glans .  <START:test>  The internal foreskin  <END>  attached to the glans is also greatly diseased with  <START:problem>  a scar-type process  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A close margin  <END>  was cut around the glans portion of the penis to excise the foreskin . Another close margin was cut on the penile shaft skin to excise the foreskin .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was obtained in the dartos layer with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  .The shaft skin was then reapproximated to the glandular foreskin using an interrupted 3-0  <START:treatment>  chromic suture  <END>  . This resulted in a very nice cosmetic effect . No  <START:problem>  other penile lesions  <END>  or  <START:problem>  abnormalities  <END>  were noted .  <START:treatment>  Sponge and needle counts  <END>  were correct x2 .  <START:treatment>  Polysporin ointment  <END>  was applied to  <START:problem>  the incision area  <END>  .

INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE : This patient has developed  <START:problem>  a tight phimosis  <END>  .  <START:test>  Examination  <END>  in the office shows that the foreskin can no longer be retracted over the glans due to a tight rim of  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  at the tip of the foreskin . The patient would like to have  <START:treatment>  a circumcision  <END>  performed and informed consent was obtained . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was placed on the operating room table in the supine position .  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  was administered via  <START:problem>  LMA  <END>  . He was placed in  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  . The genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion .  <START:test>  Examination  <END>  shows  <START:problem>  a very tight phimosis  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a small opening into the area of the foreskin  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A straight clamp  <END>  was placed on  <START:problem>  the dorsal midline  <END>  and crushed .
The clamp was then removed and scissors were used to incise the dorsal midline of the foreskin , which then spread laterally to expose the glans penis .  <START:treatment>  The ventral foreskin at the frenulum  <END>  was then crushed with  <START:problem>  a clamp and cut with scissors  <END>  .  <START:test>  The two lateral flaps of foreskin  <END>  were then removed with  <START:treatment>  sharp excision  <END>  . The underlying dartos was then examined and  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  was obtained where needed with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  . The skin of the penis was then reapproximated to the small rim of  <START:treatment>  inner foreskin at the glans  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures  <END>  . This resulted in a good cosmetic appearance and good hemostasis .  <START:treatment>  Polysporin  <END>  was then applied and the patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition .  <START:problem>  DATE OF PROCEDURE  <END>  : MM /  <START:problem>  DD  <END>  / YYYY PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Phimosis  <END>  .

POSTOPERATIVE CONDITION : Stable to the PACU . OPERATIVE FINDINGS : The patient did have  <START:problem>  a phimosis  <END>  of  <START:problem>  his foreskin  <END>  and tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  . INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old male with a history of  <START:problem>  phimosis  <END>  who elected  <START:treatment>  operative management  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was brought to the operating room by the OR and  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  staff . He was placed on the operating room table and  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  was administered without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  . The patient was intubated and  <START:problem>  his genitalia  <END>  prepped and draped in a sterile fashion .  <START:problem>  A 15 blade  <END>  was used to make  <START:problem>  a circumferential incision  <END>  approximately 5 to 7 mm from the coronal sulcus around the glans on the shaft of the penis .

The foreskin was then replaced over the glans and  <START:problem>  another circumferential incision  <END>  was made through the epidermis approximately midway between the coronal sulcus and the tip of the penis as seen through the foreskin . At this point , the foreskin was retracted again and  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  was used to dissect subcutaneously connecting both circumferential incisions . At this point , electrocautery using the Bovie was used to deglove the penis between  <START:problem>  these 2 incisions  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was then achieved with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  . At this point , a 3-0 interrupted chromic stitch was used to approximate the skin of the shaft at the 12 o'clock position and also a horizontal mattress interrupted  <START:treatment>  chromic suture  <END>  was used at the 6 o'clock position . Now that the skin of the shaft was approximated ,  <START:treatment>  interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures  <END>  were placed approximately 5 to 10 mm apart circumferentially around the shaft just proximal to the glans .

 <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was  <START:test>  hemostatic  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  was wrapped with  <START:treatment>  Vaseline gauze  <END>  , Kling wrap and loosely fitting  <START:treatment>  Coban  <END>  . The patient was awoken from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  extubated  <END>  without difficulty and transitioned to the PACU for  <START:treatment>  postoperative resuscitation  <END>  .

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : Following the induction of an adequate level of  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  , the patient was placed in supine position . The penis and surrounding areas were prepared with  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  and the patient was draped in a sterile manner .  <START:treatment>  Dorsal slit  <END>  was created by using  <START:treatment>  a straight hemostat crushing the dorsal foreskin  <END>  in the midline down to the level of the preputial tissue . The foreskin was incised and  <START:treatment>  an eventual slit  <END>  was created in a similar manner .  <START:problem>  The lateral flaps of redundant foreskin  <END>  were then excised sharply . The edges were then retracted and  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  was obtained . The edges were reapproximated using 3-0  <START:treatment>  chromic suture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A penile block  <END>  was performed by using 8 mL of 0 .  <START:test>  25 plain Marcaine  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Infiltration  <END>  occurred in 4 quadrants at the 2 , 4 , 8 and 10 o'clock positions . This was done while withdrawing to ensure that there was no  <START:problem>  vascular injury  <END>  . Tegaderm was then applied . The patient went to the recovery room in satisfactory condition .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic corneal perforation  <END>  with  <START:problem>  iris prolapse  <END>  , right eye . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic corneal perforation  <END>  with  <START:problem>  iris prolapse  <END>  , right eye . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Corneal patch graft  <END>  , right eye . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ASSISTANT : None . ANESTHESIA :  <START:treatment>  General endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION :
The right eye was draped and prepped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion without  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  in the solution .  <START:problem>  The perforation  <END>  was noted at the 3 o'clock position in the right eye .  <START:treatment>  The conjunctival Tenon peritomy  <END>  was made from the 2 o'clock position running clockwise to the 5 o'clock position . Superficial bleeders of the episclera were cauterized with  <START:treatment>  bipolar cautery  <END>  . The 6 mm trephine was found to encompass the corneal perforation and this was used to lightly score onto the cornea finding it to be suitable .  <START:treatment>  The trephine  <END>  was then placed into the old mark and pressure on the corneal side was used to score the cornea as deep as could be as the eye was somewhat soft .  <START:treatment>  A separate paracentesis  <END>  was made at the 9 o'clock position and  <START:treatment>  Viscoat  <END>  was injected into the area of the perforation only . The scoring occurred down to approximately 50 % depth .  <START:problem>  A free-hand scleral groove  <END>  was then made approximately 1 mm from  <START:problem>  the surgical limbus  <END>  and down to 50 % depth .
 <START:test>  A Feather blade  <END>  was used to dissect into the sclera advancing toward the surgical limbus .  <START:treatment>  The super-sharp blade  <END>  was used to enter  <START:treatment>  the trephination wound  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Healon  <END>  was then used to deepen this area .  <START:treatment>  The Alfonso diamond blade  <END>  was used to complete  <START:problem>  the corneal  <END>  cut to the surgical limbus . Then , using  <START:treatment>  the sharp Westcott scissors  <END>  , the donor button was then excised off  <START:treatment>  the surgical limbus  <END>  as the iris was adherent to this wound for more than a month and exposed . The iris was gently severed at the back of the cornea creating  <START:treatment>  a sector iridectomy  <END>  . There were  <START:problem>  minimal bleeders of the iris  <END>  present . The corneal specimen was then removed in total and sent for  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  Viscoat  <END>  was placed over  <START:treatment>  the exposed iris  <END>  , over the exposed lens and  <START:treatment>  sector iridectomy  <END>  . The donor button was found to be pink Optisol GS and was placed with the endothelial side up in  <START:problem>  trephination block  <END>  . The inside of the sclera was sharply cleaned with  <START:problem>  the Weck-cel  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Tooke knife  <END>  to remove  <START:problem>  any residual uveal pigment  <END>  . The limbus to cornea measured approximately 4 . 5 mm and  <START:problem>  the trephination block  <END>  was marked centrally to create a visualization mark and a 4 . 5 mm arc was placed from this central dot . The limbus was then lined up with the arc and centered and then a 6 mm  <START:treatment>  trephine punch  <END>  was used to punch the cornea and scleral rim . The donor rim and  <START:problem>  solution  <END>  were sent for  <START:test>  separate culture  <END>  . The donor cornea was then covered with  <START:problem>  Optisol GS  <END>  and covered .
The recipient was then reapproached . The donor button was brought over , placed with the endothelial side down and  <START:problem>  a sclera limbus  <END>  lined up . There was suitable apposition of  <START:problem>  the cornea  <END>  and interrupted 10-0  <START:treatment>  nylon sutures  <END>  were placed at the limbus lining up the limbus and then  <START:treatment>  the corneal sutures  <END>  were placed with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 10-0 nylon  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the knots  <END>  were rotated . The sclera was trimmed and thinned to fit into the previous dissected area and  <START:treatment>  interrupted sutures  <END>  were then used to close  <START:problem>  the most nasal aspect of the scleral incision  <END>  . The conjunctiva was then pulled up over  <START:treatment>  the corneoscleral patch graft  <END>  reattaching it at the limbus and  <START:treatment>  a stay suture at the central part of the graft  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Gentamicin  <END>  200 mg , 3 mg of  <START:treatment>  Celestone  <END>  as well as 25 mg of  <START:treatment>  Kefzol  <END>  were injected subconjunctivally .  <START:treatment>  Maxitrol ointment  <END>  was applied and  <START:treatment>  a light pressure patch  <END>  . Because this was the better eye , this eye was lightly covered and would be uncovered after  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  so that she would not have  <START:treatment>  bilateral patching  <END>  .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Invasive bladder cancer  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Invasive bladder cancer  <END>  with  <START:problem>  right spermatic cord lipoma  <END>  .  <START:test>  PROCEDURES  <END>  PERFORMED : 1 .  <START:treatment>  Radical cystoprostatectomy  <END>  . 2 .  <START:treatment>  Pelvic lymph node dissection  <END>  . 3 .  <START:treatment>  Ileal-conduit urinary diversion  <END>  . 4 .  <START:treatment>  Appendectomy  <END>  . 5 .  <START:treatment>  Resection  <END>  of  <START:problem>  right spermatic cord lipoma  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was placed in the supine position .  <START:problem>  A left median incision  <END>  was made because of the location of  <START:problem>  his future ileal-conduit  <END>  with stoma .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was carried through the fascia in the midline exposing the urachus of the bladder . The rectus was taken completely as was the posterior peritoneum in a triangular manner towards the lateral pelvic walls . The margins of  <START:treatment>  the pelvic lymph node dissection  <END>  were the lateral portion of the external iliac artery laterally , the pubic symphysis distally , the obturator nerve inferiorly and the bifurcation iliac vessels proximally . There was  <START:problem>  a very large cord lipoma on the right side  <END>  , which was dissected and tied with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk sutures  <END>  . It was checked and there was no evidence of  <START:problem>  any hernia  <END>  . The distal ureters then were clipped .  <START:test>  Frozen section  <END>  showed no  <START:problem>  carcinoma  <END>  .
 <START:test>  The lymph nodes  <END>  were negative on both sides by  <START:test>  visual examination  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The peritoneum  <END>  was incised posterior to the rectum and the bladder then was removed with the clips , occasionally using the  <START:treatment>  Harmonic scalpel  <END>  applied to the bladder and was made anterior to the rectum and extended all the way to the apex of the prostate . The bladder , prostate were removed and the pelvis then was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  copious amounts of water  <END>  . The dorsal vein complex was suture ligated with 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  excellent hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The appendectomy  <END>  was performed by Dr . Jane Doe , please see her operative report . The appendix was retrocecal . It had a long extension all the way to almost the area of the gallbladder where it terminated . The mesentery was taken away with  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  clips  <END>  as well as ties . The base of the appendix was tied with 2-0  <START:treatment>  silk sutures  <END>  and then a pursestring 3-0  <START:treatment>  silk  <END>  was placed by Dr . Jane Doe . Please see her operative report .
 <START:treatment>  The small bowel anastomosis  <END>  was performed to provide 15 cm of  <START:treatment>  ileal conduit  <END>  . The GIA-55 stapler was used for the bowel and for  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The TA-60  <END>  was used to secure the side of  <START:treatment>  the side-to-side small bowel anastomosis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Mesenteric trap  <END>  was closed . The left ureter then was placed under the sigmoid mesentery after freeing both ureters and placed into right lower quadrant . The small bowel that was used for  <START:treatment>  ileal conduit  <END>  had  <START:treatment>  the two staple lines  <END>  removed and the left ureter was sewn to the end of the bowel loop using 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  . The remainder of the ileal conduit then was closed with 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  . The right ureter was then anastomosed to the anterior mesenteric border of the mid portion of  <START:treatment>  the ileal conduit  <END>  , also with 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  . This was done over  <START:treatment>  6-French ureteral stents  <END>  . The loop then was brought into  <START:problem>  the stoma in the right lower quadrant  <END>  , which had been selected by the stoma nurse and secured in place with 2-0 Vicryl sutures to the rectus fascia and then 3-0 Vicryl to the skin with pretty good eversion so as to consider  <START:problem>  the patient 's obesity  <END>  .  <START:test>  The pulse  <END>  was checked .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was obtained .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was irrigated once again with  <START:problem>  water and then the midline incision  <END>  was closed with  <START:treatment>  running interrupted # 1 Vicryl sutures  <END>  . The skin was closed with  <START:treatment>  staples  <END>  . Dressings applied . Stoma , faceplate in binder .  <START:problem>  Estimated blood loss  <END>  about 1500 mL . The patient received 3 units of  <START:test>  blood  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : Spinal and  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 50 mL . FLUIDS : 2400 mL of  <START:treatment>  crystalloid  <END>  . URINE OUTPUT : Not recorded . COMPLICATIONS : None .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The risks , benefits , indications and alternatives of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  were reviewed with the patient . She was taken to the operating room and given  <START:treatment>  spinal anesthesia  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  placed in the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  , given  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  prepped  <END>  and draped in the usual sterile fashion . She was placed in Allen stirrups .  <START:treatment>  A 20 French three-way Foley catheter  <END>  was inserted at the outset of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A 10 mm infraumbilical stab incision  <END>  was made with  <START:treatment>  an 11 blade scalpel  <END>  while tenting the abdominal wall up .  <START:test>  A Veress needle  <END>  was inserted at a 45 degree angle . With  <START:test>  CO2 insufflation  <END>  , there was  <START:problem>  a drop in intraperitoneal pressure confirming correct placement  <END>  .  <START:test>  Insufflation  <END>  was carried out to 3 liters . Then , using  <START:treatment>  a 10 mm 0-degree lens scope  <END>  , we placed  <START:problem>  a blunt bladeless optical trocar into the 10 mm incision  <END>  . Again , excellent visualization was noted confirming  <START:treatment>  intraperitoneal placement  <END>  . We then placed 2 ports on  <START:problem>  the left-hand side  <END>  , one 2 fingerbreadths medial and superior to the ASIS and 1 handbreadth directly cephalad to that . These were 8 mm  <START:treatment>  da Vinci trocars  <END>  , which were inserted under direct visualization . We then used  <START:problem>  the 5 mm camera in the left lower quadrant  <END>  in order to lyse  <START:problem>  all of the adhesions  <END>  , done with  <START:treatment>  the laparoscope  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  sharp dissection using scissors  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  occasional monopolar cautery  <END>  . The bowel was freed in this fashion thus gaining access to the pelvis and right lower quadrant .  <START:treatment>  A similarly situated right lower quadrant port  <END>  , 8 mm , was then placed as well as  <START:treatment>  an assistance port  <END>  , 12 mm , on  <START:problem>  the right hand side  <END>  . The robot was then docked after the patient was placed in steep Trendelenburg and small bowel had been swept away out of the pelvis . The left salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out using a monopolar Endoshears as well as  <START:treatment>  Gyrus PK technology  <END>  .

The ureter was positively identified . The left infundibulopelvic ligament was cauterized x2 prior to  <START:treatment>  transection  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was noted . The entire specimen was placed in an Endobag and removed intact without any  <START:problem>  leakage  <END>  . This was sent to  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  . Rapid frozen returned benign  <START:problem>  serous cystadenoma  <END>  . Attention was then turned to the presacral space . The peritoneum overlying it was tented upward and incised sagittally all the way down to the posterior vaginal wall keeping the right ureter in view at all times . The posterior vaginal wall was dissected free from the peritoneum using monopolar Endoshears .  <START:treatment>  Two obturators  <END>  had been placed , one in the vagina , one in the rectum , to assist with  <START:problem>  this dissection  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The dissection  <END>  was carried out to 5 cm from  <START:problem>  the vaginal apex  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A similar dissection  <END>  was carried out anteriorly with the same technique .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was noted . Two 3 cm wide x12 cm long slips of Gynemesh were then placed into the peritoneal cavity .
The first was anchored to the anterior longitudinal ligament with 3 interrupted  <START:treatment>  CV-2 Gore-Tex sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  This mesh  <END>  was placed in the cul-de-sac for the time being . The second flap of mesh was anchored with 6 interrupted  <START:treatment>  CV-2 Gore-Tex sutures to the posterior vaginal wall  <END>  . This was placed behind the mesh attached to the sacrum and finally the mesh attached to the sacrum was draped over  <START:problem>  the anterior vaginal wall  <END>  and sutured with 7  <START:treatment>  interrupted CV-2 sutures  <END>  . The two slips of mesh were then combined with  <START:treatment>  CV-2 Gore-Tex sutures  <END>  in the midline .  <START:problem>  Tension  <END>  was performed to lift the vagina into the pelvic cavity to approximate the full length of the vagina in a tension-free fashion by plicating the 2 flaps of mesh again with  <START:treatment>  Gore-Tex suture  <END>  . The peritoneum was then closed with running 2-0 Vicryl with  <START:problem>  Lapra-Tys  <END>  . The pelvis was irrigated copiously and freed of  <START:problem>  all clots  <END>  and  <START:problem>  debris  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was noted .
While removing under direct visualization , the fascia , the 12 mm trocar , was closed with  <START:treatment>  a 0 Vicryl suture  <END>  and then all ports were removed with  <START:treatment>  excellent hemostasis  <END>  . The umbilical fascia was closed with  <START:treatment>  a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture  <END>  . The skin was closed with 4-0 subcuticular Vicryl . At this time , all sponge , lap ,  <START:treatment>  needle and instruments counts  <END>  were correct x2 .  <START:treatment>  The posterior repair  <END>  was then performed placing a 3 cm sagittal incision from the hymenal ring cephalad dissecting the vaginal epithelium away from the underlying muscularis tissue and then finally plicating the levator and muscularis tissue in the midline with 4 interrupted 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Vaginal epithelium  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  hymenal ring  <END>  were then closed with 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl running suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was noted .  <START:test>  Cystoscopy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a 17 French 30-degree lens cystoscope  <END>  revealed the findings noted above . The bladder was then allowed to drain with a 14 French Foley and the vagina was packed with  <START:treatment>  vaginal tape packing  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well , was extubated and transferred to postoperative recovery room awake and in stable condition . At the conclusion of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  all sponge  <END>  , lap , needle , and  <START:treatment>  instrument counts  <END>  were correct x2 .

PROCEDURE FINDINGS : There was  <START:problem>  hernia mesh just beneath the umbilical incision  <END>  . There were  <START:problem>  dense omental and bowel adhesions  <END>  under the mesh ; however , we were able to enter the peritoneal cavity and  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tubes  <END>  appeared normal bilaterally . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : After informed consent was obtained , risks ,  <START:treatment>  benefits  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  alternatives  <END>  were reviewed at length with the patient . She understood that  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  would be permanent and irreversible and would carry approximately 1 % failure rate , and she was also advised of  <START:problem>  the increased risk of ectopic pregnancy  <END>  should failure occur . The patient voiced her understanding of all issues presented and desired to proceed with  <START:treatment>  the tubal ligation  <END>  .
The patient was taken to the operating room where she was placed supine on the operating table and underwent induction of  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  via  <START:treatment>  endotracheal tube  <END>  . She was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . A 1 . 5 cm  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  was made through the umbilicus .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was carried down through the fascia and  <START:treatment>  the mesh material  <END>  from her previous  <START:treatment>  umbilical hernia repair  <END>  . Careful and  <START:problem>  meticulous dissection of adhesions beneath this mesh material  <END>  was then carried out  <START:problem>  utilizing Army-Navy  <END>  and then small Deaver retractors for  <START:problem>  visualization  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A small area free of adhesions of the peritoneum  <END>  was identified , and this area was entered bluntly and then the Deaver retractors were used to visualize the uterus and  <START:treatment>  fallopian tubes  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The left fallopian tube  <END>  was identified . It was elevated through  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The fallopian tube  <END>  was very carefully traced out of its fimbriated end and fimbriated end had been positively identified .
 <START:treatment>  Fallopian tube  <END>  was  <START:problem>  carefully traced to its mid portion  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  mid portion fallopian tube  <END>  was elevated through  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  . The knuckle of  <START:treatment>  fallopian tube  <END>  thus formed was ligated at the base with 0  <START:treatment>  plain gut suture  <END>  and ligated portion of  <START:treatment>  fallopian tube  <END>  was excised .  <START:treatment>  Both tubal ostia  <END>  were visualized and noted to be  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  . The intervening segment of  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  was sent for  <START:test>  pathologic evaluation  <END>  . Similarly , the  <START:treatment>  right fallopian tube  <END>  was identified , carefully traced out from its fimbriated end , fimbriated end had been positively identified . The fallopian tube was  <START:treatment>  carefully re-traced at its mid portion and the mid portion of fallopian tube  <END>  was elevated through  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  . The knuckle of  <START:treatment>  fallopian tube  <END>  thus formed was ligated at the base with 0  <START:treatment>  plain gut suture  <END>  . The ligated portion of  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  was excised and sent for  <START:test>  pathologic evaluation  <END>  . Once again , both tubal ostia were visualized and noted to be  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  and returned to in situ position .
 <START:treatment>  All instruments  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  packing material  <END>  were then removed .  <START:treatment>  The instrument  <END>  , sponge and  <START:problem>  lap counts  <END>  were correct at this time .  <START:treatment>  The fascia  <END>  and mesh at the umbilicus were then reapproximated with  <START:treatment>  a running suture  <END>  of 2-0 Prolene .  <START:test>  Palpation  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  the mesh  <END>  noted to be intact with no evidence of  <START:problem>  hernia  <END>  . The skin edges were then reapproximated with 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular suture  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were applied . The patient underwent  <START:treatment>  reversal of anesthesia  <END>  , was extubated and taken to the postanesthesia care unit in good condition . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  .

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was taken to the operating room where after establishing adequate  <START:treatment>  epidural anesthesia  <END>  and after sterilely prepping and draping the patient ,  <START:problem>  a small infraumbilical midline incision  <END>  was made extending in layers into the abdominal cavity without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . The left tube was found and followed to its fimbriated end .  <START:treatment>  The mid portion of the tube  <END>  was elevated and a loop of  <START:problem>  tube ligated in its base  <END>  with 2 free ties of  <START:problem>  0 plain suture  <END>  . The loop of  <START:treatment>  tube  <END>  was amputated using  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  . There was  <START:problem>  adequate hemostasis in the stumps  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  was terminated . At this point , the right side was then approached .

FINDINGS :  <START:problem>  Large submucosal leiomyoma  <END>  . The uterus sounded to 10 cm .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room , placed on the table in the supine position and after adequate  <START:treatment>  general LMA anesthesia  <END>  , she was transferred to  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  , prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .  <START:test>  Examination under anesthesia  <END>  revealed the uterus to be approximately 8 to 9 weeks in size . No  <START:problem>  adnexal masses  <END>  . The patient had first- and  <START:problem>  second-degree uterine descent  <END>  .  <START:test>  The weighted speculum  <END>  was inserted into the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with  <START:treatment>  a single-tooth tenaculum  <END>  . The uterus was sounded to 10 cm .  <START:treatment>  The diagnostic hysteroscope  <END>  using a 3 mm Versascope was used and the patient was noted to have  <START:problem>  a very thin endometrium  <END>  and  <START:problem>  tubal ostia  <END>  appeared to the normal . The shape of the cavity was normal with the exception that the patient had  <START:problem>  a large submucosal leiomyoma  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a broad base  <END>  coming from the right lateral wall of the uterine cavity .
This leiomyoma had  <START:problem>  some prominent vessels on the surface  <END>  but was mostly white and smooth and appeared to be benign on  <START:problem>  gross inspection  <END>  . The remainder of the cavity was normal .  <START:treatment>  The hysteroscope  <END>  was removed and  <START:treatment>  a fractional curettage  <END>  was performed . The endocervix was curetted with  <START:treatment>  an endocervical curette  <END>  and this was sent as a separate specimen . The cervix was serially dilated up to #  <START:treatment>  23 dilator  <END>  in order to admit the larger curette .  <START:treatment>  A # 1 curette  <END>  was used to curette the uterine cavity and there was  <START:problem>  some brisk bleeding on curettage  <END>  , presumably from the fibroid .
The uterine balloon was then used to attempt  <START:treatment>  a ThermaChoice ablation  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The balloon  <END>  was checked with 5 mL for  <START:problem>  any leaks  <END>  , none were noted to be present . Then , the balloon was inserted into the uterine cavity and 30 mL of D5W was used to inflate the balloon , but  <START:test>  the pressure  <END>  could not be maintained . The balloon was then deflated and retracted . The balloon was again inspected and it was felt that there was no  <START:problem>  leakage  <END>  at all from  <START:treatment>  the balloon  <END>  , so a second attempt was made to reposition the  <START:treatment>  ThermaChoice balloon ablation  <END>  . The ThermaChoice was situated to the point where it was felt that it was towards the left side of the cavity and around  <START:problem>  the submucosal myoma  <END>  . It was inflated with 35 mL of D5W and it did reach  <START:problem>  a pressure  <END>  of 160 , but while we were attempting to insufflate with warm water , within the first minute ,  <START:test>  the pressure  <END>  dropped to 110 and  <START:treatment>  the machine  <END>  cut off . The balloon was withdrawn again and checked .
There were no  <START:problem>  leaks  <END>  present . It was felt that  <START:test>  the patient 's uterine cavity  <END>  was probably too large for  <START:treatment>  the uterine balloon  <END>  , and therefore , no  <START:problem>  further attempts  <END>  were made to perform  <START:treatment>  an ablation  <END>  . It may have also been that  <START:problem>  the fibroid  <END>  was obstructing the expansion of the balloon properly . The cervix was cauterized with  <START:treatment>  silver nitrate  <END>  after removing  <START:treatment>  the tenaculum  <END>  and then all the instruments were removed from the vagina . The patient was placed back in the supine position , awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition .

ANESTHESIA : General . FINDINGS :  <START:problem>  Right ectopic pregnancy  <END>  located in the cornual section of  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  . COMPLICATIONS : None .
INDICATION FOR OPERATION : This patient is a ( XX ) -year-old gravida 4 , para 2 ,  <START:problem>  AB  <END>  1 at approximately 7 weeks ' gestation who presented with  <START:problem>  vaginal bleeding  <END>  and  <START:problem>  cramping  <END>  .  <START:test>  An ultrasound  <END>  performed in the emergency department showed  <START:problem>  right ectopic pregnancy  <END>  . After discussion with the patient , decision was made to  <START:treatment>  perform laparoscopic surgery  <END>  to remove the ectopic pregnancy . Full details and risks of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  were discussed at length with the patient , and the patient was in full agreement . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was taken to the operating room , placed under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  and prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner .  <START:treatment>  Speculum  <END>  was placed in the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped with  <START:treatment>  a single tooth tenaculum  <END>  .
Then ,  <START:problem>  a uterine manipulator  <END>  was placed in through the cervix .  <START:treatment>  The speculum  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  tenaculum  <END>  were then removed . Attention was then turned to the abdomen where  <START:problem>  an infraumbilical incision  <END>  was made and  <START:test>  a Veress needle  <END>  was introduced into the peritoneal cavity .  <START:treatment>  A pneumoperitoneum  <END>  was then created with  <START:test>  CO2 gas  <END>  . Then ,  <START:treatment>  a 5 mm trocar  <END>  was introduced through  <START:problem>  the infraumbilical incision site  <END>  and this was followed by the scope . This showed good entry to the peritoneal cavity . There was  <START:problem>  minimal bleeding  <END>  and there was noted to be  <START:problem>  a large ectopic in the cornual section  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A suprapubic midline incision  <END>  was made and  <START:treatment>  a 5 mm trocar  <END>  was introduced under direct visualization . Then ,  <START:problem>  another incision  <END>  was made in  <START:problem>  the left lateral abdomen  <END>  and 12 mm trocar introduced under  <START:test>  direct visualization  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A grasper  <END>  was placed through the suprapubic port and  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  was grasped .  <START:treatment>  The Harmonic scalpel  <END>  was used initially and then it malfunctioned .
Because  <START:test>  the cornual section  <END>  was so thick , the area had to be bovied because of  <START:problem>  oozing  <END>  coming from the cornual region of  <START:treatment>  the fallopian tube  <END>  . Then ,  <START:treatment>  the scissors  <END>  were attempted to be used to cut and coagulate  <START:problem>  the cornual section  <END>  and this was not very successful . Finally , the Endostapler was introduced into the pelvis and  <START:problem>  several small bites  <END>  were taken , stapled , and finally the ectopic was excised from the uterus .  <START:treatment>  The ectopic within the fallopian tube  <END>  was then placed into  <START:treatment>  a pouch  <END>  and removed through  <START:problem>  the lateral incision at the left lateral incision site  <END>  . Then ,  <START:treatment>  the coagulative Bovie tip  <END>  was introduced into the pelvis again and the portion of the uterus that remained after  <START:treatment>  the entire fallopian tube  <END>  was excised was coagulated and made  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Irrigation  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  suctioning  <END>  was performed and there was noted to be good hemostasis . The upper abdomen was visualized and noted to be within normal limits . The right and left ovary appeared to be within normal limits as well as  <START:treatment>  the left fallopian tube  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  The procedure  <END>  was then terminated by removing the suprapubic and  <START:test>  left lateral instruments under direct visualization  <END>  .  <START:test>  The scope  <END>  was removed and  <START:test>  the CO2 gas  <END>  was allowed to escape . Finally ,  <START:treatment>  the infraumbilical trocar sheath  <END>  was removed . The incisions were closed with 2-0 and 3-0 Vicryl ,  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  and  <START:problem>  Band-Aids  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  All the instruments  <END>  were removed from the cervix and vagina , and the patient was awakened from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  and transferred to recovery room in  <START:problem>  satisfactory condition  <END>  .

The main risks included but were not limited to  <START:problem>  infection  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  nerve injury  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  bleeding complications  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  loss of elbow range of motion  <END>  , strength and function ; continued  <START:problem>  numbness  <END>  and  <START:problem>  weakness  <END>  in the hand ; possible need for  <START:treatment>  revision surgery  <END>  and  <START:problem>  other anesthetic complications  <END>  . The patient understood all these risks and wished to proceed with  <START:treatment>  surgery  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was taken to the operating room and was placed in a supine position . The patient was administered  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A tourniquet  <END>  was placed over her left upper arm and she was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . The extremity was exsanguinated with 300  <START:test>  mmHg pressure  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A longitudinal incision  <END>  was made slightly anterior to the medial epicondyle , extending in a curvilinear fashion both proximally and distally .
It was kept above the medial epicondyle to  <START:problem>  avoid wound problems  <END>  from the bony prominence .  <START:problem>  This incision  <END>  was taken through the skin and  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissue  <END>  only .  <START:treatment>  Careful scissors dissection  <END>  was taken through the underlying soft tissues until the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified . As soon as the antebrachial cutaneous nerve was identified , this was dissected free from the surrounding soft tissues and  <START:treatment>  a Penrose drain  <END>  was placed around this nerve . The nerve was then retracted out of the operative field superiorly .  <START:treatment>  Self-retraining retractor  <END>  was then placed in  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Further dissection  <END>  was taken to find the nerve superior to the cubital tunnel . Once it was identified here , the nerve was followed along distally into the cubital tunnel . The nerve was completely freed up of all surrounding soft tissues proximally and into the cubital tunnel . The cubital tunnel was then slowly released . Distally , the ulnar nerve was carefully dissected to identify the branches to the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle .
Once  <START:treatment>  these nerve branches  <END>  were identified ,  <START:problem>  part of the flexor pronator muscle mass  <END>  was incised to ensure that there was no compression of the nerve into the muscular area . The motor branches of the ulnar nerve were carefully protected throughout this release . With the ulnar nerve freely released from soft tissue , it was brought anteriorly and placed to a full range of motion to ensure that there was no  <START:treatment>  constriction  <END>  of the nerve throughout the course .  <START:treatment>  A finger  <END>  was placed superiorly and  <START:treatment>  an Army-Navy retractor  <END>  was placed to the superior border of the incision to ensure that there was no  <START:problem>  constriction  <END>  of the nerve throughout , even beyond the plane of the dissection . The flexor pronator muscle group was then identified from the insertion on the medial epicondyle with  <START:problem>  a slight portion of the tendon  <END>  left on the medial epicondyle for  <START:treatment>  later repair  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Sharp dissection  <END>  was used to divide the flexor pronator muscle group . This was then elevated from the underlying above structures with  <START:treatment>  a Freer elevator  <END>  .
The ulnar nerve was then transposed to a submuscular location and the tendon was reapproximated with 4 horizontal mattress # 2  <START:treatment>  Arthrex FiberWire sutures  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  an excellent repair  <END>  of the tendon was ensured and the elbow was placed through a gentle range of motion to ensure that there was no  <START:treatment>  compression of the ulnar nerve  <END>  in the submuscular location . My fifth finger was also placed into the tunnel for the nerve and placed through a range of motion and there was no  <START:treatment>  constriction  <END>  or  <START:treatment>  compression  <END>  with full flexion or extension . A 2-0 Vicryl was then placed in the subcutaneous tissue followed by a running subcuticular 4-0  <START:treatment>  Monocryl suture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Sterile  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  Adaptic  <END>  , 4 x 4 's , Webril and  <START:treatment>  a long-arm plaster splint  <END>  was placed .  <START:treatment>  Tourniquet  <END>  was let down prior to placement of  <START:treatment>  all dressings  <END>  and there was no  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  encountered and  <START:treatment>  excellent hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:test>  Total tourniquet time  <END>  was 46 minutes . The patient awoke from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  . She was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition . There were no problems to the nerve when checked in the recovery room .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Brow ptosis  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Brow ptosis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:test>  Endoscopic brow lift  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ASSISTANT : None . ANESTHESIA : General . INDICATIONS OF PROCEDURE : The patient presents with  <START:problem>  brow ptosis  <END>  . She has had a previous upper and  <START:problem>  lower eyelid blepharoplasty  <END>  . She has lateral hooding in the center of the brow below the orbital rim . The patient understands that we can not guarantee perfectly symmetrical results and results may not be  <START:problem>  long-lasting  <END>  . There is a risk for  <START:problem>  frontal nerve branch injury  <END>  that could lead to permanent brow  <START:treatment>  paralysis  <END>  , there could be brow asymmetry , there could be  <START:problem>  scar alopecia  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  permanent scars  <END>  on the scalp ,  <START:problem>  numbness of the forehead  <END>  , need for  <START:treatment>  revisional procedures  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  blood clots  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  heart attack  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  stroke  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  visible scars  <END>  , even  <START:problem>  death  <END>  , as well as  <START:problem>  lagophthalmos  <END>  and she has agreed to proceed .
 <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Less than 100 mL . SPECIMENS SENT : None . DRAINS : None . COMPLICATIONS : None . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : After identification of the patient and obtaining informed consent , she underwent  <START:treatment>  following procedure  <END>  . In the preoperative holding area in the presence of the patient 's girlfriend , she was marked . I marked out the present location of the brows , marked out the orbital rim , and planned area of  <START:problem>  elevation of the brows  <END>  in a curvilinear shape , elevating them approximately 1 cm in greatest distance with  <START:problem>  a taper type of markings  <END>  . The patient was taken to  <START:treatment>  the major operative suite  <END>  and placed on the table in the supine position . She underwent  <START:treatment>  induction  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  intubation  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Antibiotic prophylaxis  <END>  was given and  <START:treatment>  sequential compression stockings  <END>  placed for  <START:problem>  deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis  <END>  .
The hair was placed in braids , and face and hair were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . I injected the forehead and scalp with 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  lidocaine  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  . I made 2 small incisions posterior to the hairline in center of the scalp , and  <START:problem>  two temporal hairline incisions  <END>  , posterior to the hairline . Using  <START:treatment>  a periosteal elevator  <END>  , I elevated in the subperiosteal plane using combination of  <START:treatment>  a lighted breast retractor  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  an endoscope  <END>  . I used 3-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene sutures  <END>  , 2 on each side , to pexy  <START:problem>  the periosteum  <END>  above the brow central laterally and medially and then pexy them to  <START:treatment>  2 small screws  <END>  placed in the outer cortex of the bone . They were 8-mm screws and  <START:treatment>  the sutures  <END>  were tied to them in a symmetrical fashion elevating the brow and creating the lateral hooding without  <START:problem>  creating lagophthalmos  <END>  . I then resected approximately 1 . 5 cm of scalp posterior to  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  in the temporal hair area to help correct the lateral hooding and achieved  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  saline containing bacitracin  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Excellent hemostasis  <END>  was obtained . I should note , that we did score the fascia centrally in the glabellar area where there was some rhytids to help reduce the rhytids in this area without affecting the brow elevation . We closed  <START:problem>  the scalp incision  <END>  using 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  subdermally in buried fashion and  <START:treatment>  surgical clips  <END>  .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Loss of  <START:test>  atrial lead capture  <END>  , status post  <START:treatment>  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator pacemaker pocket revision  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES : Loss of  <START:test>  atrial lead capture  <END>  , status post  <START:treatment>  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator pacemaker pocket revision  <END>  . OPERATIONS PERFORMED : Explantation of  <START:treatment>  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator generator  <END>  ,  <START:test>  reposition of right atrial pacing lead  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  reimplantation  <END>  of  <START:problem>  implantable cardioverter-defibrillator generator  <END>  and  <START:test>  fluoroscopy  <END>  with interpretation . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old male who had been operated on earlier in the day for  <START:problem>  a painful ICD pocket  <END>  where the generator was moving all over the place . He had  <START:problem>  very poor tissues  <END>  and the generator , which was in a good location when he was supine , shifted down a lot . We had revised  <START:problem>  the pocket  <END>  and placed the generator subpectorally , as well as sewed it down to the ribs to help stabilize . 
The interrogation at the end of the case showed that the generator and  <START:treatment>  all the leads  <END>  were functioning satisfactorily . However , when the patient was taken to the recovery room and sat up , the atrial lead lost capture and  <START:test>  a chest x-ray  <END>  done in  <START:problem>  an erect position  <END>  showed that the atrial lead had become loose .  <START:test>  The preoperative chest x-rays  <END>  had suggested that  <START:test>  the atrial lead  <END>  was possibly a little short . We had not mobilized  <START:treatment>  these leads  <END>  at all above their tie down sleeves in the operating room , to keep from making them too mobile . Because the lead had shifted and lost capture , we went ahead and brought the patient back to the operating room to  <START:test>  reposition this lead  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought back to the operating room and  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  readministered with  <START:treatment>  an LMA tube  <END>  .
We went ahead and prepped and draped the chest again and then reopened the pocket . We cut down through the area of the pectoralis muscle to the generator . We considered just removing the atrial lead because the generator was tied down at three different points . However , we thought that there was  <START:treatment>  a second screw  <END>  to hold the atrial lead in . We , therefore , explanted the generator at this point , removing  <START:treatment>  all three sutures  <END>  but leaving the sutures where they were sewn through the ribs and tied as a base , to suture later . We explanted the generator and then removed the atrial lead . We now mobilized  <START:treatment>  the tie-down sleeve  <END>  . It became apparent that  <START:treatment>  the tie-down sleeve  <END>  was loose and not snug on the lead and that the lead was shifting in it . We mobilized the lead completely and excised  <START:treatment>  the fibrous tissue  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  sutures  <END>  on  <START:treatment>  the tie-down sleeve  <END>  . We then put a stylet down the lead and used  <START:treatment>  fluoroscopy  <END>  to reposition the lead . We positioned it in a location that looked like it was moving in the atrium . Here , we had a good P wave of 1 . 7 millivolts with  <START:problem>  an impedance  <END>  of 397 ohms and  <START:treatment>  a pacing voltage  <END>  threshold of 0 . 9 volts at 0 . 5 milliseconds . This was good and we left extra length in , so that it would not shift again . We now tied it down with three sutures to the pectoralis fascia , up where it had been tied before . It felt strong and did not move on tugging . It looked like that it was in . We also checked it again several times with  <START:test>  fluoroscopy  <END>  to be sure it did not move . We now reconnected it to  <START:treatment>  the ICD generator  <END>  and placed it back and then reimplanted it in the subpectoral pocket we had created earlier . We used  <START:treatment>  the same sutures  <END>  which had worked out so well to secure it so that it did not move from before . We placed  <START:treatment>  Ti-Cron sutures under the loops  <END>  that were tied into the ribs and then placed them back in their same holes on the generator header , as well as  <START:treatment>  a third suture  <END>  around the body of the generator to keep it from swinging very much . We tied things down , looked solid , and on  <START:test>  fluoroscopy  <END>  , the leads look well positioned behind it . We then irrigated everything with  <START:treatment>  antibiotic solution  <END>  and closed  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  absorbable sutures  <END>  as usual .

OPERATION PERFORMED : Planned  <START:treatment>  extracapsular cataract extraction  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  posterior chamber intraocular lens implant  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . COMPLICATIONS : None . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was brought to the operating room after  <START:treatment>  adequate preoperative sedation  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Intravenous line  <END>  and  <START:test>  cardiac monitor  <END>  were initiated . The patient was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion after smooth induction of  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  . Attention was directed to the right eye where  <START:treatment>  a Lieberman wire lid speculum  <END>  was placed between the lids of the right eye .  <START:treatment>  A fornix-based conjunctival flap  <END>  was raised through the superior 3 o'clock with  <START:treatment>  Westcott scissors  <END>  using blunt and  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was obtained with  <START:treatment>  wet-field cautery  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A partial-thickness limbal groove  <END>  , 3 clock , was fashioned superiorly .
The anterior chamber was entered at the 12 o'clock position with a 75 Beaver blade .  <START:test>  A bent 25 gauge needle and cystotome  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  a Healon syringe  <END>  was introduced into the anterior chamber . The chamber was deepened with  <START:treatment>  Healon  <END>  and  <START:problem>  an anterior capsulotomy  <END>  was performed through 360 degrees in can-opener fashion . The lens nucleus was rocked free from the cortex .  <START:problem>  The limbal wound  <END>  was opened with  <START:treatment>  corneoscleral scissors  <END>  , first passing left then right . With  <START:treatment>  gentle pressure  <END>  from above and below , the lens nucleus was expressed from the eye and noted to be brunescent .  <START:problem>  The limbal wound  <END>  was secured with 3 interrupted 8-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  . The irrigation /  <START:treatment>  aspiration handpiece  <END>  was introduced into the anterior chamber .  <START:problem>  Cortical cleanup  <END>  was performed uneventfully . A good red reflex was noted . The posterior capsule remained intact . The capsular bag was filled with  <START:treatment>  Healon  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The limbal wound  <END>  was secured nasally and temporally with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures whose knots  <END>  were buried .  <START:treatment>  The Vicryl sutures  <END>  were removed .
The 20 . 5 diopter posterior chamber  <START:treatment>  intraocular lens implant  <END>  was inspected under the operating microscope and found to be  <START:problem>  free of defect  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The lens implant  <END>  was placed in the eye with the inferior J looping reposited behind the iris leaflet and within the capsular bag . The superior J loop was then placed behind the iris leaflet and within the capsular bag using one-hand maneuver . The lens was rotated such that  <START:test>  its major axis  <END>  was from the 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock positions . The lens was noted to be well centered and stable .  <START:treatment>  Healon  <END>  was removed from the anterior chamber .  <START:treatment>  Miochol  <END>  was instilled and the pupil became  <START:treatment>  miotic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was secured centrally with an additional 5 interrupted 10-0  <START:treatment>  nylon sutures whose knots  <END>  were buried .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was tested and found to be watertight .  <START:treatment>  Subconjunctival gentamicin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Solu-Medrol  <END>  were administered .  <START:treatment>  Maxitrol ointment  <END>  was instilled .  <START:treatment>  The lid speculum  <END>  was removed . The eye was patched . The patient was returned to the recovery room in satisfactory condition .

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old left-hand dominant male who presents with  <START:problem>  complaints  <END>  of locking and triggering in the right long and ring fingers . He also complained of  <START:problem>  a mass over the distal palmar crease of the right ring finger  <END>  and we discussed with him the risks and benefits of  <START:treatment>  surgical intervention  <END>  including  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  infection  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  damage  <END>  to nerve ,  <START:problem>  blood vessels  <END>  , muscle ,  <START:problem>  persistent triggering  <END>  and  <START:problem>  recurrence of mass  <END>  . The patient consented to  <START:treatment>  surgical intervention  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : After the patient was identified in the preoperative holding unit , the right upper extremity was marked by the operating surgeon as the operative site . One gram of  <START:treatment>  IV Ancef  <END>  was administered for  <START:treatment>  antibiotic prophylaxis  <END>  . The patient was taken to the operating room where  <START:treatment>  a surgical time-out  <END>  was performed by the circulating nurse verifying the operative procedure .
 <START:treatment>  A pneumatic tourniquet  <END>  was placed on the right proximal arm , and  <START:problem>  a block  <END>  for  <START:problem>  release of the A1 pulley  <END>  along the long and ring finger was performed proximal to the distal palmar crease using 0 . 25 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  and 1 %  <START:treatment>  lidocaine  <END>  . The right upper extremity was then prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion and Esmarch was used for  <START:problem>  exsanguination  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  pneumatic tourniquet  <END>  was inflated to 250 mmHg .  <START:problem>  A transverse incision  <END>  along the border of the distal palmar crease of the long and ring fingers was then made .  <START:problem>  Careful dissection  <END>  was carried down over the flexor tendon sheath of the ring finger and we immediately identified what appeared to be  <START:problem>  a retinacular cyst  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was performed around the retinacular cyst which was excised off of  <START:problem>  the A1 pulley  <END>  . We then performed  <START:problem>  an A1 pulley release  <END>  excising  <START:problem>  a central slip of the A1 pulley  <END>  to prevent  <START:problem>  recurrence  <END>  . Each slip of  <START:problem>  the FDS  <END>  and the FDP were then delivered to  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  with no  <START:problem>  significant adhesions  <END>  or  <START:problem>  synovial thickening  <END>  present .
We then inspected the radial aspect of  <START:test>  the wound over the long finger flexor tendon sheath  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues and  <START:problem>  neurovascular bundles  <END>  along the radial and ulnar aspect of  <START:test>  the long finger flexor tendon sheath  <END>  were protected throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  . The proximal portion of the A1 pulley was identified and the A1 pulley of the long finger was transected excising  <START:test>  a central slip of the A1 pulley  <END>  to prevent  <START:problem>  recurrence  <END>  or  <START:problem>  new formation of the pulley  <END>  . We then examined and  <START:problem>  dissected proximally the palmar pulley  <END>  which was incised with  <START:treatment>  the tenotomy scissors  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was copiously irrigated and closed used 5-0 nylon in  <START:problem>  horizontal mattress fashion  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Xeroform gauze  <END>  was applied to  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  followed by 4 x 4 gauze , followed by Conform and Ace wrap . Tourniquet was deflated and the patient was recovered from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  and discharged to the PACU in stable condition .

FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE : The patient was brought to the operating room and prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion in the supine position . After adequate  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  was obtained ,  <START:problem>  an incision  <END>  was made over the left rectus sheath approximately 2 cm below the left costal margin . This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissues with  <START:treatment>  Bovie electrocautery  <END>  and through  <START:problem>  the abdominal wall musculature  <END>  with the same . The abdomen was opened through the peritoneum and into the abdominal cavity . The liver was retracted superiorly and the stomach was visualized underneath this . The stomach was brought up into  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  , and using 3-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl stitches  <END>  , 2 circular pursestring  <START:treatment>  Stamm gastrostomy sutures  <END>  were placed in the anterior wall of the stomach . We then made  <START:treatment>  a gastrotomy opening within the stomach using the Bovie electrocautery  <END>  and placed a 12-French Pezzer catheter into this gastrostomy site . The pursestrings were then tied around  <START:treatment>  the Pezzer catheter  <END>  and the catheter itself was left open .
The pursestrings were then tied around  <START:treatment>  the Pezzer catheter  <END>  and the catheter itself was left open . We then closed the fascia of  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  using 4 interrupted 3-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  along the full thickness of the anterior fascia and peritoneum , all the way through full thickness of the musculature , to close  <START:problem>  the abdominal wall  <END>  . Then , the skin was closed with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 5-0 Monocryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The tube  <END>  was then taped in place . The patient was woken up out of  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  and brought back to the neonatal intensive care unit . There were no  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  during  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  and the patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well . There was  <START:problem>  a large air leak from the gastrostomy tube  <END>  after final placement . This is consistent with  <START:problem>  this patient 's tracheoesophageal fistula  <END>  .

REFERRING PHYSICIAN : John Doe , MD REASON FOR CONSULTATION : Evaluation and  <START:treatment>  management  <END>  of  <START:problem>  rash  <END>  . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : Thank you for  <START:problem>  this infectious disease consultation  <END>  . The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old female who had a bout of  <START:problem>  pharyngitis  <END>  about 5 weeks prior to admission .  <START:problem>  The pharyngitis  <END>  appeared to persist , was given a dose of  <START:treatment>  Biaxin  <END>  which did not seem to help her too much . Later on , the patient started developing what appeared to be another type of  <START:problem>  pharyngeal reaction  <END>  and possible  <START:problem>  recurrent infection  <END>  . The patient was also given  <START:treatment>  a course of antibiotics  <END>  which consisted of  <START:treatment>  Cipro  <END>  . The patient then started noticing  <START:problem>  a nodular lesion  <END>  occurring mostly over the hands and upper extremities bilaterally , as well as  <START:treatment>  some involvement of both knees  <END>  . This was accompanied by  <START:problem>  some slight arthralgias  <END>  and also a complaint of swollen left toe along with  <START:problem>  increasing tenderness  <END>  over one of the plantar areas of the foot .The patient did not have  <START:problem>  any noticeable fevers  <END>  that were documented ; however , did feel hot and continued to complain of  <START:problem>  some night sweats  <END>  which has been ongoing , and at this point , still remains  <START:treatment>  diaphoretic  <END>  . Also has had  <START:problem>  some weight loss  <END>  over the last few weeks or so with  <START:problem>  a poor appetite  <END>  secondary to  <START:problem>  pharyngitis  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The sore throat  <END>  has resolved actually to a large degree at this time . No  <START:problem>  other symptoms  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  diarrhea  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  nausea  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  vomiting  <END>  . Did not have  <START:problem>  any chest pain  <END>  or  <START:problem>  shortness of breath  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  other HEENT symptoms  <END>  other than the pharyngitis mentioned above . Full 10 points reviewed with the patient are negative other than as mentioned above .  <START:problem>  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY  <END>  : Otherwise , unremarkable . Does have  <START:problem>  some mild hypertension  <END>  and  <START:problem>  anxiety  <END>  . MEDICATIONS :  <START:treatment>  Medication list  <END>  has been reviewed . Has been on  <START:treatment>  Effexor  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  lisinopril  <END>  , more recently on  <START:treatment>  the antibiotics  <END>  mentioned above . Was given a dose of  <START:treatment>  vancomycin  <END>  in the ED .
ALLERGIES : No  <START:problem>  known allergies  <END>  . SOCIAL HISTORY : Does not use any tobacco , alcohol or drugs . No  <START:problem>  recent travel abroad  <END>  . The patient does not have  <START:treatment>  any pets  <END>  at home . No  <START:problem>  recent camping  <END>  . Does not have  <START:problem>  HIV risk factors  <END>  . No history of injection drug use . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : GENERAL : The patient is alert and oriented , in no  <START:problem>  acute distress  <END>  . Does appear anxious and is  <START:problem>  diaphoretic  <END>  .  <START:test>  VITAL SIGNS  <END>  : Temperature 97 . 6 ,  <START:test>  blood pressure  <END>  136 / 78 ,  <START:test>  respirations  <END>  21 ,  <START:test>  heart rate  <END>  80 . HEENT : Normal . Normocephalic and  <START:problem>  atraumatic  <END>  . Pupils are equal and reactive . Oropharynx is clear without  <START:problem>  any lesions  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  thrush  <END>  . NECK : Supple without  <START:problem>  lymphadenopathy  <END>  . HEART : Regular rate and rhythm without any  <START:problem>  murmurs  <END>  . LUNGS : Clear to  <START:test>  auscultation  <END>  bilaterally . ABDOMEN : Soft ,  <START:problem>  nontender  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  nondistended  <END>  . The inguinal area is normal . EXTREMITIES : Lower extremities are without  <START:problem>  cyanosis  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  clubbing  <END>  or  <START:problem>  edema  <END>  .
SKIN : Examination shows  <START:test>  a torso  <END>  and back that is free of  <START:problem>  any lesions  <END>  . However , the upper extremities bilaterally from the hand to halfway up the forearm does reveal areas of  <START:problem>  scattered nodules  <END>  with  <START:problem>  central umbilical depression  <END>  . The central area appears to be  <START:problem>  slightly necrotic  <END>  or possibly having some sort of  <START:problem>  small eschar  <END>  . There are probably about dozen or so nodules bilaterally on the upper extremities .  <START:problem>  The lower extremity nodules  <END>  are  <START:problem>  a little bit more diffuse  <END>  and are less present , but they appear in  <START:problem>  small areas over the knees bilaterally  <END>  . Over the lower extremity , plantar area of the left foot , there is  <START:problem>  a slightly erythematous nodule  <END>  that is over the plantar aspect and  <START:problem>  slightly tender  <END>  to  <START:test>  palpation  <END>  . This is right below the first metatarsal of the left foot . Skin is quite warm and moist . NEUROLOGIC : Grossly nonfocal . LABORATORY DATA :  <START:problem>  White count  <END>  was initially  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  with  <START:test>  a white count  <END>  of 14 . 4 . It was predominantly  <START:treatment>  neutrophilic  <END>  . Currently ,  <START:test>  the white count  <END>  is normal . MEDICAL DECISION MAKING : The differential is still broad in this case and it is difficult to make  <START:problem>  a determination  <END>  just based on  <START:problem>  morphology alone  <END>  . The differential remains broad and includes  <START:problem>  bacterial pathogens  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  fungal and viral pathogens  <END>  . Extensive orders have been written and include  <START:problem>  Bartonella  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  Chlamydia  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  Mycoplasma  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  staphylococci  <END>  , crypto , blasto , histo ,  <START:problem>  CMV  <END>  and EBV among others . Probably , we will not be able to get a diagnosis through serology alone and  <START:test>  a biopsy  <END>  will be necessary . RECOMMENDATIONS : 1 . We would check  <START:problem>  HIV status  <END>  . We will also check  <START:test>  a viral load  <END>  in case this is  <START:problem>  an acute HIV syndrome  <END>  . 2 . We will check  <START:test>  the RPR  <END>  . 3 .  <START:problem>  Chlamydia titers  <END>  . 4 . Histo , cocci , blasto and  <START:problem>  cryptococcal titers  <END>  . All the orders have been written . 5 . We will start the patient on  <START:treatment>  doxycycline IV  <END>  . 6 . The patient needs  <START:test>  a dermatology evaluation  <END>  . Thank you , Dr . Doe , for allowing me to participate in this patient 's care . We will follow along with you .

After adequate  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  was obtained and  <START:treatment>  intravenous antibiotics  <END>  were given , the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . A time-out was then taken to confirm the identity of the patient ,  <START:treatment>  consented procedure  <END>  and correct extremity . After  <START:treatment>  this time-out  <END>  , the right lower extremity was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and  <START:treatment>  the skin inferomedial  <END>  and inferolateral patella was injected with 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  bupivacaine  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A small stab incision  <END>  was then made inferolateral to the patella .  <START:treatment>  The arthroscopic camera  <END>  was introduced . The joint was then distended and  <START:test>  diagnostic arthroscopy  <END>  then ensued . The medial and lateral gutters were visualized . There was no evidence of  <START:problem>  synovial hypertrophy  <END>  or  <START:problem>  loose bodies  <END>  . The medial compartment was then entered , as the knee was held in the flexed position with the valgus stressed.
 <START:test>  A spinal needle  <END>  was then inserted inferomedial to the patella for localization in the anteromedial portal . Once this position was confirmed ,  <START:problem>  a small stab incision  <END>  was then made .  <START:treatment>  Arthroscopic probe  <END>  was introduced . The articular cartilage of  <START:test>  the medial femoral condyle  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  mild grade  <END>  1 changes of  <START:problem>  chondromalacia  <END>  .  <START:test>  The medial tibial plateau  <END>  also revealed  <START:problem>  some mild grade 1 changes of chondromalacia  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The anterior middle third of the medial meniscus  <END>  appeared to be pristine . However , beginning at the junction of the middle posterior third of the meniscus , extending posteriorly to the posterior root , there was noted to be what appeared to be  <START:problem>  a horizontal cleavage tear  <END>  , but what was in fact the superior leaf , was  <START:problem>  a large radial parrot-beak tear  <END>  , which had flipped superiorly up onto itself .  <START:test>  Upon probing  <END>  , it was easily displaceable into the joint . Given these findings , decision was made to proceed with  <START:treatment>  partial medial meniscectomy  <END>  .
Using combination of  <START:problem>  arthroscopic biters  <END>  and  <START:problem>  arthroscopic shavers  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  this large superior flap tear  <END>  was excised , taking great care in preserving as much normal cartilage as possible .  <START:problem>  A smooth transition zone  <END>  was created between the area of normal meniscus and the area where  <START:treatment>  the partial meniscectomy  <END>  was performed . Upon completion of  <START:treatment>  this partial meniscectomy  <END>  , the remaining meniscus was aggressively probed to ensure that a stable rim remains . The intercondylar notch was then visualized . The anterior cruciate ligament was visualized and probed . There was mild evidence of  <START:problem>  attentuations  <END>  , but no  <START:problem>  frank laxity  <END>  upon probing of the ACL . The lateral compartment was then entered as the knee was held in the figure-of-4 position . The articular cartilage of  <START:test>  the lateral femoral condyle and lateral tibial plateau  <END>  revealed no evidence of  <START:problem>  chondromalacia  <END>  . The posterior horn of  <START:problem>  the lateral meniscus  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  some very mild fraying  <END>  at the very edge , but for the most part , there was no evidence of  <START:problem>  a frank meniscus tear  <END>  .
The knee was then copiously irrigated and then drained free of  <START:problem>  any debris  <END>  . The portals were then closed using buried simple interrupted stitches of 4-0 Monocryl . The knee was injected with 10 mL of 0 . 5 % mL  <START:treatment>  bupivacaine  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were applied .  <START:treatment>  Sterile dressings  <END>  were applied . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well . There were no  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  All needle  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  sponge and instrument counts  <END>  were correct and the patient was transported stable and extubated to the postanesthesia care unit .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Acute appendicitis  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Acute appendicitis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic appendectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD SEDATION :  <START:treatment>  General endotracheal anesthetic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . COMPLICATIONS : None . INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old female who presented with signs and  <START:problem>  symptoms  <END>  consistent with  <START:problem>  acute appendicitis  <END>  . She was seen on  <START:test>  preoperative CT imaging  <END>  to have  <START:problem>  an inflamed appendix  <END>  . The risks and benefits of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  including the possibility of  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  infection  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  intra-abdominal abscess  <END>  and the need for  <START:treatment>  open operation  <END>  were reviewed in detail with the patient and the patient agreed to proceed with  <START:treatment>  the operation  <END>  .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After informed consent was obtained , the patient was then brought to the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position . After induction of  <START:problem>  the general anesthetic , the abdomen  <END>  was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . The patient had been given  <START:treatment>  preoperative platelet transfusions  <END>  secondary to  <START:problem>  thrombocytopenia  <END>  noted in the emergency room , as well as  <START:problem>  platelet function assay abnormality  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Platelets  <END>  were completely transfused to the patient prior to  <START:problem>  the first incision  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A small stab incision  <END>  was made through the umbilicus through which a bladeless 11 mm trocar was inserted without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . After  <START:treatment>  establish the pneumoperitoneum  <END>  , the patient was placed in Trendelenburg position .  <START:treatment>  Two additional 5 mm trocars  <END>  were inserted in the left lower abdomen , all under  <START:test>  direct visualization  <END>  . An obviously inflamed ,  <START:problem>  edematous  <END>  and  <START:problem>  borderline gangrenous appendix  <END>  was seen adherent to  <START:problem>  the anterior abdominal wall  <END>  . 
The terminal ileum was also draped over in a rather adherent fashion . Combination of  <START:problem>  blunt dissection  <END>  as well as  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  were used to gently remove the terminal ileum from the inflamed appendix . There was  <START:problem>  a small deserosalized area  <END>  on the anterior surface of the terminal ileum that was buttressed with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 3-0 silk suture  <END>  tied laparoscopically . To  <START:treatment>  perform this repair  <END>  , the more superior 5 mm trocar was upsized to  <START:treatment>  an 11 mm trocar  <END>  . The mesoappendix was then divided with  <START:treatment>  an Ace Harmonic scalpel  <END>  with good hemostasis . The base of the appendix was clearly identified in relationship to the cecum and  <START:treatment>  terminal ileum  <END>  . The appendiceal base was then ligated with 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl Endoloop suture  <END>  and the more distal appendiceal stump was ligated as well with a second 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl Endoloop suture  <END>  . The point between the Endoloops was then divided with  <START:treatment>  Harmonic scalpel  <END>  and the appendix was then placed in  <START:treatment>  an EndoCatch bag  <END>  and removed from the umbilical port side with no contact made between the contents of  <START:treatment>  the bag  <END>  and the skin or  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  . The right lower quadrant was then copiously irrigated , suctioned dry and inspected for  <START:treatment>  adequate hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A 15 mm Blake drain  <END>  was then placed in the vicinity of  <START:treatment>  the serosal repair  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the appendiceal stump  <END>  and brought out through  <START:problem>  the inferior 5 mm trocar site  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  All needle and sponge counts  <END>  were correct at the conclusion of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  . The umbilical fascial defect was closed with 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  a cone closure device  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the skin incisions  <END>  were then anesthetized with  <START:treatment>  a local anesthetic  <END>  and closed in subcuticular fashion . Drain was secured to the skin with  <START:treatment>  a nonabsorbable suture  <END>  .

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Acute on  <START:problem>  chronic cholecystitis  <END>  with  <START:problem>  cholelithiasis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe ,  <START:treatment>  MD SEDATION  <END>  : General . FINDINGS :  <START:problem>  Enlarged gallbladder  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  pericholecystic fluid  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  thickened gallbladder wall with cholelithiasis  <END>  . COMPLICATIONS : None . <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : About 20 mL . INDICATION FOR OPERATION : This is a ( XX ) -year-old female status post  <START:treatment>  laparoscopic gastric bypass  <END>  3 years ago , who presented with acute onset of  <START:problem>  right upper quadrant pain  <END>  . The patient had  <START:problem>  a large palpable gallbladder on exam  <END>  and was tender .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After consent was obtained , the patient was taken back to the operating room and placed in  <START:treatment>  a supine position  <END>  . After  <START:treatment>  induction  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  endotracheal intubation  <END>  , the abdomen was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion . Entrance was gained into the abdomen using  <START:problem>  infraumbilical incision  <END>  using a Hasson technique . Then , 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl stay sutures  <END>  were placed in the fascia and Hasson port was  <START:problem>  advanced into the abdomen  <END>  , followed by the 10 mm scope . The gallbladder was visualized and it was very large . Next , 5 mm ports were then inserted into the abdomen under direct visualization , first into the midline just below the xiphoid and the next two along the right costal margin . Next , because the gallbladder was very large and  <START:problem>  tense  <END>  , through one of the right subcostal ports , the gallbladder was aspirated using  <START:treatment>  needle aspirator  <END>  . Approximately 30 mL of sludge and bile were evacuated from the gallbladder . Next , the gallbladder was then retracted cephalad and the peritoneum was stripped off the gallbladder . There was noted to be  <START:problem>  a short cystic artery  <END>  and the gallbladder was partially intrahepatic . The cystic duct was then dissected free . The common bile duct was visualized . Clips were placed on  <START:problem>  the cystic duct and the duct  <END>  was transected . Next , the cystic artery was isolated . It was doubly clipped proximally and clipped distally and transected . Next , the gallbladder was removed from the liver bed using electrocautery , and once the gallbladder was removed from the liver bed , it was placed into an Endocatch and removed through the infraumbilical port . It should be noted that because the gallbladder was so large that again we had to aspirate bile out of the gallbladder to remove it through the infraumbilical port . There was  <START:problem>  some leakage of bile into the wound  <END>  . After the gallbladder was successfully removed , again the 10 mm scope was placed into the abdomen .
The liver bed was evaluated . There was  <START:problem>  a small laceration at the junction of the liver  <END>  and the falciform ligament due to  <START:problem>  retraction of the gallbladder  <END>  . This was controlled with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  ; however , there was still a small amount of  <START:problem>  blood seen  <END>  at the site .  <START:treatment>  A small piece of Surgicel  <END>  was placed over  <START:problem>  the active bleeding  <END>  . The abdomen was then irrigated copiously with 2 liters of  <START:treatment>  saline  <END>  until the aspirate was clear . Next ,  <START:problem>  the ports  <END>  were removed under direct visualization and the fascia was closed with 0  <START:treatment>  interrupted Vicryl stitches  <END>  . After  <START:treatment>  the fascia  <END>  was closed in the infraumbilical port , the wounds were  <START:treatment>  all irrigated out with saline  <END>  and closed with  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular stitches  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wounds  <END>  were dressed with  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Mastisol  <END>  and dressed with  <START:treatment>  gauze  <END>  and  <START:problem>  Tegaderm  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  this procedure  <END>  well .  <START:treatment>  Sponge and instrument counts  <END>  were correct at the end of the case . The patient was extubated in the operating room without event and transferred to recovery room in stable condition .
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Biliary dyskinesia  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Biliary dyskinesia  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 25 mL . COMPLICATIONS : None . OPERATIVE FINDINGS : There were no  <START:problem>  adhesions  <END>  . Gallbladder itself appeared reasonably normal , but there did appear to be  <START:problem>  a tiny stone  <END>  within it once we opened it on the back table .  <START:problem>  DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION  <END>  :  <START:problem>  A small infraumbilical incision  <END>  was used .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was deepened into the rectus fascia . The fascia was incised . The abdomen was entered in usual fashion , and 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl stay sutures  <END>  were placed under direct vision . At this point , the abdomen was insufflated with 15 cm of  <START:problem>  pressure  <END>  , and the patient was placed in reverse Trendelenburg . Three 5 mm ports were placed in the epigastrium ,  <START:test>  all under direct vision  <END>  . The fundus of the gallbladder was then grasped and flipped up and over the liver . 
The neck was retracted laterally and caudad , exposing  <START:test>  the ductal structures  <END>  , which were dissected out . The cystic duct was doubly clipped and transected as was the cystic artery . The gallbladder was then removed from the gallbladder fossa using electrocautery .  <START:problem>  A small posterior branch  <END>  was clipped as well .  <START:problem>  A small hole  <END>  was made within the gallbladder allowing  <START:problem>  moderate bile spillage  <END>  . Prior to complete  <START:treatment>  removal of the gallbladder  <END>  , the liver bed was then inspected and  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  was achieved with  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  . The gallbladder was then placed into  <START:test>  an endoscopic bag  <END>  and removed from the abdomen . The ports were placed back into the abdomen . The right upper quadrant was reinspected and irrigated out with about 2 liters of  <START:treatment>  sterile saline  <END>  . There was no  <START:problem>  ongoing bleeding  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  bile spillage  <END>  . Therefore ,  <START:test>  all the ports  <END>  were removed under direct vision and infiltrated with local .  <START:problem>  The fascia  <END>  and skin were infiltrated with local . The fascia was closed with 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  and the skin with 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular suture  <END>  ,
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Acute cholecystitis  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Acute cholecystitis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD SPECIMEN : Gallbladder and stones . COMPLICATION : None .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . FINDINGS : Inflamed and  <START:problem>  thickened gallbladder  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After informed consent was obtained , the patient was taken to the OR and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion .  <START:problem>  A small incision  <END>  was made at the base of the umbilicus . Then ,  <START:problem>  the abdominal cavity  <END>  was entered through the umbilical defect .  <START:treatment>  A 5 mm port  <END>  was then placed through this umbilical defect and  <START:test>  CO2 insufflation begun  <END>  . After adequate  <START:treatment>  pneumoperitoneum  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  two additional 5 mm ports  <END>  were placed in the right upper quadrant , along with  <START:problem>  an 11 mm port in the subxiphoid area  <END>  . The gallbladder appeared to be very thickened and inflamed , consistent with  <START:problem>  acute cholecystitis  <END>  . At this point ,  <START:treatment>  a decompression needle  <END>  was introduced , and  <START:problem>  a small amount of bilious fluid  <END>  was then aspirated .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  began by peeling away the thickened peritoneum in the triangle of Calot , to reveal  <START:problem>  a cystic duct  <END>  as it entered directly into the gallbladder . The cystic duct is clipped and divided . The cystic artery is seen just medial to the cystic duct in the usual location and also clipped and divided . The gallbladder was gently moved from the liver bed with  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  and retrieved through the subxiphoid port site into a specimen bag . The area of  <START:treatment>  dissection  <END>  was then irrigated with  <START:treatment>  saline solution  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was achieved with  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  .  <START:test>  CO2  <END>  and irrigate were then aspirated . Ports were removed . The fascial defect at the umbilical and subxiphoid areas were reapproximated with 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl  <END>  . Skin was reapproximated with 4-0 Vicryl . The patient was returned to recovery in stable condition .
PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Acute calculus  <START:problem>  cholecystitis  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Acute calculus  <START:problem>  cholecystitis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General endotracheal .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 30 mL . COMPLICATIONS : None .  <START:problem>  OPERATIVE FINDINGS  <END>  : 1 . White bile consistent with  <START:problem>  cystic duct obstruction  <END>  . 2 .  <START:problem>  Numerous gallstones  <END>  . 3 .  <START:problem>  Gallbladder wall thickening  <END>  . 4 . Final needle and  <START:treatment>  sponge counts  <END>  correct . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old Hispanic female seen and evaluated in the office with  <START:problem>  intermittent abdominal pain  <END>  .  <START:test>  An ultrasound of the gallbladder  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening  <END>  suggestive of  <START:problem>  cholecystitis  <END>  . The patient was scheduled for  <START:treatment>  laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operative room . She was positioned supine on the operative room table .  <START:treatment>  Pneumatic compression stockings  <END>  were applied and inflated . After induction of  <START:treatment>  adequate general endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the area over the abdomen  <END>  was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .  <START:problem>  A small umbilical incision  <END>  allowed for  <START:test>  introduction of the Veress needle  <END>  and insufflation of the abdomen to 15 cm of  <START:test>  water pressure  <END>  using  <START:test>  carbon dioxide gas  <END>  . The 0 degree ,  <START:problem>  5 mm laparoscope  <END>  was introduced through  <START:treatment>  a 5 mm port at the umbilicus  <END>  , and 3 additional ports were placed in their usual anatomic positions . The gallbladder was found to be contracted and  <START:problem>  partially intrahepatic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Retraction of the gallbladder  <END>  did allow for identification of the triangle of Calot .  <START:problem>  The cystic duct and cystic artery  <END>  were both skeletonized .  <START:treatment>  Two clips  <END>  were used to  <START:treatment>  control the cystic duct distally  <END>  and one at the level of the gallbladder with good hemostasis and no evidence of  <START:problem>  a bile leak  <END>  following  <START:treatment>  transection  <END>  . The cystic artery was controlled in much the same fashion , with good  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  following  <START:treatment>  transection  <END>  . The gallbladder was then dissected away from the liver in what was felt to be an inflamed ,  <START:problem>  less-than-optimal plane  <END>  . Nonetheless ,  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  was controlled using  <START:treatment>  low-wattage cautery  <END>  , and  <START:problem>  blood loss  <END>  was limited to 30 mL for  <START:treatment>  the entire procedure  <END>  . Once the gallbladder was freed from  <START:treatment>  its attachments of the liver  <END>  , it was placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through the upper midline port site fascial defect . The upper midline fascia was closed using 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture under direct vision  <END>  with the aid of the Endo Close apparatus . The gallbladder fossa was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  a small amount of normal saline  <END>  , all of which was aspirated completely .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was excellent at the end of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  . 
Both lateral ports were removed under direct vision with good hemostasis at both sites . The omentum was tucked into the gallbladder fossa and the patient was repositioned supine . The abdomen was desufflated through  <START:treatment>  the umbilical port  <END>  , which was subsequently removed .  <START:problem>  All four incisions  <END>  were infiltrated with  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  0 . 25 % with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  and each  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  was closed using 5-0  <START:problem>  PDS suture  <END>  in  <START:problem>  a subcuticular fashion  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Dermabond skin glue  <END>  was used to seal each of the 4 incisions . The patient was awakened , extubated and moved to the recovery room in satisfactory condition . She tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well . There were no  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  .  <START:test>  Final needle and sponge counts  <END>  were correct . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - DATE OF OPERATION : MM /  <START:problem>  DD  <END>  /  <START:problem>  YYYY PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  <END>  : 1 .  <START:problem>  Cholelithiasis  <END>  . 2 .  <START:problem>  Biliary colic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES  <END>  : 1 .  <START:problem>  Cholelithiasis  <END>  . 2 .  <START:problem>  Biliary colic  <END>  .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . OPERATIVE FINDINGS : The gallbladder wall was thickened . It was not acutely inflamed . There were  <START:problem>  numerous tiny 1 mm stones  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : With the patient adequately anesthetized under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  , the abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual fashion . With the patient in steep Trendelenburg ,  <START:problem>  an infraumbilical incision  <END>  was performed .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was performed down to the fascia , which was grasped with  <START:treatment>  a towel clamp  <END>  and  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  .  <START:test>  A Veress needle  <END>  was then inserted and the abdomen was inflated to 15 mmHg .  <START:test>  The Veress needle  <END>  was removed , and  <START:treatment>  an 11 mm trocar  <END>  was inserted in the epigastrium .  <START:test>  A cursory inspection of the abdomen  <END>  revealed no  <START:problem>  remarkable findings  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The 5 mm trocars  <END>  were then inserted into  <START:treatment>  the anterior axillary line  <END>  and the midclavicular line subcostally .  <START:test>  A second 11 mm trocar  <END>  was inserted in the epigastrium . The gallbladder was grasped and retracted cephalad .
The cystic duct was bluntly dissected free from its surrounding attachments . After positively identifying  <START:problem>  the common bile duct , the cyst duct  <END>  was doubly clipped and divided . The cystic artery branched just before its attachment to the gallbladder . Both of these branches were identified , clipped , and divided . Electrocautery was then used to remove the gallbladder from the gallbladder bed .  <START:problem>  Any bleeding vessels in the gallbladder  <END>  bed were electrocauterized . The gallbladder was then removed through  <START:problem>  the umbilical wound under direct vision  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Copious irrigation  <END>  was performed of the right upper quadrant .  <START:problem>  A final inspection of the gallbladder  <END>  bed revealed it to be dry .  <START:test>  All free solution  <END>  was sucked out of the abdomen and  <START:test>  all trocars  <END>  were removed . The umbilical fascia was closed with  <START:treatment>  a figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl suture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  All skin wounds  <END>  were closed with 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular stitches  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were applied to  <START:problem>  the wounds  <END>  , which were dressed , and the patient returned to the recovery room awake , extubated , and in stable condition .  <START:problem>  All counts  <END>  were correct at the end of the case x2 .

BLOOD PRODUCTS : None .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old female with  <START:problem>  classic biliary colic  <END>  . She has had no  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  of  <START:problem>  abnormal liver function tests  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  pancreatitis  <END>  , and  <START:problem>  her common bile duct  <END>  is normal by  <START:test>  ultrasound  <END>  .
OPERATIVE FINDINGS : The patient has evidence of  <START:problem>  pretty significant chronic cholecystitis  <END>  with  <START:problem>  multiple adhesions  <END>  adhered to the gallbladder . These were dissected free . The rest of the intra-abdominal anatomy is fairly normal . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After verbal and  <START:treatment>  visual identification  <END>  , the patient was placed in the supine position on the operating room table .  <START:test>  Monitoring devices  <END>  were applied along with  <START:treatment>  pneumatic compressive stockings  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Prophylactic antibiotics  <END>  were given . An adequate level of  <START:treatment>  general endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  was established . The abdomen was then prepped with  <START:problem>  ChloraPrep  <END>  and draped in a sterile fashion .  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  0 . 5 % with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was used to infiltrate  <START:treatment>  all port sites  <END>  prior to their placement . The initial port was placed just above into the right of the umbilicus and the midportion of the right rectus abdominis muscle . In this location , a 5 mm Xcel port and a 0  <START:problem>  degree 5 mm scope  <END>  were used to do  <START:test>  a direct abdominal entry under direct vision  <END>  . 
Once access to the peritoneal cavity was established , insufflation was begun . Three additional ports were placed in standard location for  <START:treatment>  laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  an 11 mm port in the subxiphoid location  <END>  and 2 5 mm ports on  <START:treatment>  the right costal margin  <END>  . The gallbladder fundus was grasped with  <START:problem>  an atraumatic grasper  <END>  . Multiple adhesions had to be taken down by blunt and  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  along with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  . Eventually , we identified the infundibulum , and this was then grasped and retracted inferior and laterally .  <START:treatment>  Dissection  <END>  was then begun in the angle of Calot .  <START:problem>  Cystic duct , cystic artery  <END>  were all clearly identified , and  <START:problem>  the cystic artery  <END>  and duct was dissected for approximately 2 cm .  <START:treatment>  Two clips proximally  <END>  and one clip distally were used to  <START:treatment>  control both the cystic duct and cystic artery  <END>  . Both were then transected with  <START:treatment>  laparoscopic shears  <END>  . The gallbladder was then removed from its fossa in a retrograde fashion using electrocautery .
It was placed in an EndoCatch bag and extracted to 11 mm port site . We then irrigated down the cavity with  <START:treatment>  a copious amount of saline  <END>  , and the area was aspirated dry . We inspected the gallbladder fossa and there was no  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  or  <START:problem>  bile leak  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Clips on the cystic duct and cystic artery  <END>  appeared to be secured . Briefly , explored the abdomen . There was no other evidence of  <START:test>  overt pathology  <END>  . The cystic ports were all then removed under direct vision . The skin edge was then approximated with inverted interrupted 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  sterile surgical dressings  <END>  were applied . The patient was then awakened from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  , extubated , and transported to the recovery room . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well .

OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General endotracheal . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was placed in a supine position on the operating table and  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  induced . The abdomen was shaved , prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  , and draped in the usual manner .  <START:treatment>  Venodyne boots  <END>  were in place . The patient was placed in Trendelenburg position .  <START:problem>  A 1 cm curved incision  <END>  was made just below the umbilicus .  <START:treatment>  The linea alba  <END>  was grasped and  <START:test>  a disposable Veress needle  <END>  passed into the peritoneal cavity . After  <START:problem>  verifying its intraperitoneal position  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  carbon dioxide  <END>  was insufflated through it to  <START:problem>  an intraperitoneal pressure  <END>  of 15 mmHg .  <START:treatment>  The laparoscope  <END>  and camera were then introduced through a 10 mm cannula in this location and the entry of the abdomen examined . The gallbladder was  <START:problem>  mildly distended  <END>  , but was not  <START:problem>  tense  <END>  . The visualized portions of  <START:problem>  the liver  <END>  , stomach ,  <START:problem>  small and large intestine  <END>  appeared normal . There was no  <START:problem>  inguinal hernia  <END>  present . The patient was then placed in reverse Trendelenburg position and attention directed to the right upper quadrant .  <START:treatment>  The 5 mm cannulae  <END>  were introduced through the anterior axillary and  <START:problem>  midclavicular lines in the right side  <END>  . The gallbladder was grasped and retracted over the liver .  <START:treatment>  Dissectors  <END>  were introduced through a 10 mm cannula in the upper midline . The hepatoduodenal ligament was dissected . The cystic duct was isolated and traced from the gallbladder to the common duct . It was small in size and  <START:test>  the ERCP  <END>  had been done preoperatively . No  <START:test>  cholangiogram  <END>  was therefore performed .  <START:problem>  The cystic duct  <END>  was lifted twice proximally and once distally across the gallbladder and then divided .  <START:problem>  Further dissection  <END>  revealed  <START:treatment>  the cystic artery  <END>  which was also similarly lifted twice proximally and once distally and then divided . The gallbladder was then dissected away from its bed on the liver using a combination of  <START:problem>  blunt dissection  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  .
The gallbladder was then dissected away from its bed on the liver using a combination of  <START:problem>  blunt dissection  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  cautery  <END>  . During  <START:problem>  this dissection  <END>  , small opening was made in the gallbladder and  <START:problem>  some bile came  <END>  out . This was aspirated . Before detaching the gallbladder completely from the liver , we checked for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  which was adequate . The gallbladder , after being freed , was placed within an endobag and retrieved through  <START:problem>  the epigastric port site  <END>  . The sub and  <START:problem>  suprahepatic areas  <END>  were irrigated with  <START:treatment>  saline  <END>  until the returns were clear .  <START:treatment>  The cannulae  <END>  were withdrawn .  <START:treatment>  The port sites  <END>  were  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Marcaine  <END>  0 . 25 % was infiltrated into all the port sites . The fascia was closed at the two midline openings with 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  using  <START:test>  a J needle  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The skin incisions  <END>  were closed with 3-0 and 4-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Band-Aid dressings  <END>  were applied .  <START:problem>  Blood loss  <END>  was minimal .  <START:treatment>  Tape and instrument counts  <END>  were reported correct .

Normal-appearing uterus , left ovary ,  <START:treatment>  tubes  <END>  and liver . 4 . There were  <START:problem>  adhesions  <END>  noted extending from the left colon to  <START:problem>  the left pelvic sidewall  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a strand of adhesion  <END>  extending from the small bowel to the anterior abdominal wall . SPECIMEN SENT :  <START:problem>  Cyst wall and right ovarian cyst  <END>  .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 25 mL . IV FLUIDS : 2000 mL of lactated Ringer 's .  <START:test>  URINE OUTPUT  <END>  : 85 mL .
NDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old G1 admitted with a diagnosis of  <START:problem>  complex right adnexal mass  <END>  measuring about 8 x 6 . 5 cm .  <START:problem>  The mass  <END>  had been causing  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  for about 3 to 4 weeks . The patient had been referred for  <START:test>  preoperative evaluation  <END>  due to history of  <START:problem>  leukopenia  <END>  and was given  <START:test>  preoperative clearance  <END>  . All risks and benefits of  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  had been discussed with the patient in clinic . All her questions were answered . The patient was taken to the operating room in stable condition . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was taken to the OR where she was placed under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . She was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and placed in  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  .
 <START:test>  A preoperative bimanual examination  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  findings  <END>  as above . Attention was turned to the vagina , where  <START:test>  a weighted speculum  <END>  was placed in the vagina and the anterior lip of the cervix was grasped using  <START:treatment>  a single-toothed tenaculum  <END>  . The Cohen cannula was then inserted through the cervix without  <START:problem>  difficulty and the weighted speculum  <END>  was removed . The bladder had been drained with  <START:treatment>  a Foley catheter  <END>  that was placed in the bladder . Attention was then turned to the abdomen where  <START:problem>  an approximately 10 mm skin incision  <END>  was made in the umbilical fold .  <START:problem>  Entry into the peritoneum  <END>  was done using the open method . The fascia was identified and incised and  <START:problem>  the fascia  <END>  and peritoneum were entered using  <START:treatment>  a blunt Kelley clamp  <END>  . At this time , the 10 mm trocar was placed through  <START:problem>  the umbilical incision  <END>  and confirmation of  <START:treatment>  intraabdominal placement  <END>  was confirmed under direct visualization by the camera . The abdomen was insufflated using approximately 4 liters of  <START:test>  CO2 gas  <END>  .
At this time , the second incision was made using  <START:problem>  a 5 mm incision  <END>  and  <START:problem>  5 mm trocar in the left lower quadrant  <END>  and the third trocar was inserted also using  <START:problem>  a 5 mm incision in the right lower quadrant  <END>  .  <START:test>  Examination of the pelvis  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  findings  <END>  as above . At this time , the left ovarian cyst appeared to be normal . Attention was turned to the right ovary which was mobilized out of the pelvis . An approximately 5 to 6 cm  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  was made along the ovary using electrocautery . At this point , it was dissected initially using hydrodissection and  <START:problem>  using blunt dissection  <END>  . Entry into the cyst was created using the electrocautery . Suction was used to  <START:treatment>  drain scant fluid  <END>  at this time from the cyst . However , with  <START:treatment>  suction  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  a large globular piece  <END>  of  <START:problem>  cyst  <END>  was obtained that appeared to be  <START:treatment>  coagulated blood  <END>  with congealed fat that appeared to be consistent with  <START:problem>  a dermoid  <END>  . This was placed in the anterior cul-de-sac . At this time , the cyst wall was identified and was removed using blunt dissection with  <START:treatment>  countertraction  <END>  . The ovarian bed w
as then irrigated and dried . There was  <START:problem>  slight oozing  <END>  noted near the edge of the ovary , obtained  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  . The pelvis was then irrigated , and once  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  was assured , the Endo  <START:problem>  Catch bag  <END>  was placed through the 10 mm port and the cyst wall components as well as the right ovarian cyst were placed in the Endo  <START:problem>  Catch bag  <END>  and removed through the 10 mm incision without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . At this time , the pelvis was again copiously irrigated and dried .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was assured .  <START:treatment>  A Seprafilm  <END>  was applied to the right ovary for  <START:treatment>  adhesion prevention  <END>  . At this time ,  <START:treatment>  all instruments  <END>  were removed under visualization .  <START:problem>  The 10 mm umbilical incision  <END>  was closed using 2 interrupted stitches of 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  and the skin was closed using interrupted stitches of 4-0  <START:treatment>  Monocryl suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were placed after closure with 4-0 suture in the lateral ports .  <START:treatment>  All instruments  <END>  were removed . There was  <START:problem>  slight oozing  <END>  noted at the site of the single-toothed tenaculum insertion , obtained  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  ring forceps  <END>  pressure and  <START:problem>  Monsel solution  <END>  . Once  <START:treatment>  all instruments  <END>  were removed , the patient was cleaned . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Adenocarcinoma of the colon . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon without intraoperative evidence of  <START:problem>  metastasis  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Laparoscopic transverse colectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General endotracheal with  <START:treatment>  epidural  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room and had  <START:treatment>  an epidural catheter  <END>  placed . She was induced and  <START:treatment>  intubated  <END>  . She was repositioned in  <START:treatment>  a low lithotomy position in Allen stirrups  <END>  and had  <START:treatment>  a Foley catheter  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  orogastric tube  <END>  placed for  <START:treatment>  decompression  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Pneumatic compression hose  <END>  was placed prior to the induction of  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  and remained on throughout the procedure to prevent  <START:problem>  thrombosis  <END>  and possible  <START:problem>  embolism  <END>  . The patient was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion . The patient has had  <START:problem>  a previous right lower quadrant incision  <END>  for  <START:problem>  appendicitis  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a lower midline incision  <END>  .
 <START:problem>  An infraumbilical vertical incision  <END>  was made in the skin for  <START:treatment>  the camera port  <END>  . The umbilicus was retracted anteriorly using  <START:treatment>  Backhaus towel forceps  <END>  .  <START:test>  The Veress needle  <END>  was passed through  <START:problem>  the midline abdominal fascia  <END>  into the peritoneal cavity , and the peritoneal cavity was insufflated with  <START:test>  carbon dioxide  <END>  which was maintained at  <START:test>  a pressure  <END>  of 15 mmHg .  <START:treatment>  The Optiview camera port  <END>  was passed through  <START:problem>  the abdominal wall fascia under direct camera vision into the peritoneal cavity  <END>  . There were  <START:problem>  adhesions  <END>  of  <START:problem>  the omentum to the midline wound  <END>  , which also tethered the transverse colon to  <START:problem>  the midline wound  <END>  . The abdomen was carefully inspected laparoscopically . There was  <START:problem>  India ink in the left colon  <END>  and this was initially thought to be the site of  <START:problem>  the tumor  <END>  . The left colon was mobilized by scoring the lateral peritoneal reflection and dissecting the loose areolar connective tissue plane posterior to the mesocolon .
There was  <START:treatment>  limited staining  <END>  at this site however , and I suspect this stain was residual India ink that was in  <START:treatment>  the sclerotherapy needle when saline  <END>  was injected to perform  <START:treatment>  a polypectomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  the colonoscope  <END>  leaving a small spot of ink in that location .  <START:problem>  Adhesions  <END>  were taken down from  <START:problem>  the splenic flexure  <END>  and also the hepatic flexure was exposed , but there was no  <START:problem>  sight of India ink  <END>  in any of these locations . The transverse colon could be observed laparoscopically from the hepatic flexure to its point of  <START:problem>  midline adhesion  <END>  and also from the splenic flexure to its point of  <START:problem>  midline adhesion  <END>  but could not be completely visualized in the midline . We judged that the site of  <START:problem>  the tumor  <END>  must be in the area of  <START:problem>  adhesion at the midline wound  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The infraumbilical portion of the midline wound  <END>  was opened sharply through the skin and was carried through  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissue  <END>  and  <START:problem>  midline abdominal fascia  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Adhesions of the omentum  <END>  were taken down under direct vision with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  and this allowed the previously
The site showed the India ink tattoo and  <START:problem>  the palpable colon cancer  <END>  . Sites were selected proximally and distally to the tumor where the transverse colon was cleaned with  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  . The transverse mesocolon was harvested using the LigaSure device to resect adjacent mesentery and  <START:treatment>  lymph-bearing tissue  <END>  . The associated omentum was also excised . The transverse colon was reconstructed over  <START:treatment>  Dennis clamps  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 4-0 silk sutures utilizing RB-1 needles  <END>  in the usual fashion . At the completion of  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  , there was no  <START:problem>  tension  <END>  and both limbs of bowel showed no evidence of  <START:problem>  ischemia  <END>  . The lumen of  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  was widely patent by  <START:test>  palpation  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The anastomosis  <END>  was returned to the abdomen .
 <START:problem>  Midline abdominal fascia  <END>  was closed with running 0  <START:treatment>  PDS suture  <END>  and the skin was closed with  <START:problem>  subcuticular  <END>  4-0  <START:treatment>  Monocryl suture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The 5 mm port sites that were placed in the left mid abdomen  <END>  and in the suprapubic area were closed with  <START:problem>  subcuticular  <END>  4-0 Monocryl .  <START:treatment>  Benzoin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were used to dress  <START:problem>  all skin incisions  <END>  . The laparoscopic portion of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  utilized  <START:treatment>  a 12 mm infraumbilical port and 5 mm instrument ports  <END>  x3 . Two were through  <START:problem>  the previous lower midline incision  <END>  and one was in the left mid abdomen .  <START:treatment>  Instrument and sponge counts  <END>  were correct .  <START:problem>  Estimated blood loss  <END>  was less than 25 mL . The patient was revived from  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  and was taken to the recovery area in good condition.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Varicocele . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Varicocele . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:test>  Laparoscopic varicocele ligation  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ASSISTANT : Jane Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : This ( XX ) -year-old was seen with  <START:problem>  a significant varicocele of the left testis  <END>  . It was causing  <START:problem>  occasional discomfort  <END>  and there was  <START:problem>  some difference in the consistency of the testes  <END>  , with the left being softer than the right . Given these findings ,  <START:treatment>  a laparoscopic varicocelectomy  <END>  was recommended that was completed using the Palomo technique in the following fashion . FINDINGS AND PROCEDURE : The patient was placed under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  , and in  <START:problem>  the supine position , the abdomen and genitalia  <END>  were prepped and draped in the sterile fashion .  <START:problem>  An incision  <END>  was made along the umbilical crease , hiding it inferiorly . The subcutaneous tissues were separated with  <START:treatment>  selective cautery  <END>  . The infraumbilical cord was grasped with  <START:treatment>  a towel clip  <END>  and lifted .
 <START:test>  The Veress needle  <END>  was used to insufflate the abdomen .  <START:test>  Laparoscopic review of the findings  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  an impressive bundle of veins on the left side  <END>  located above the perivasal vasculature . There were  <START:treatment>  actually 2 bundles  <END>  , one of which was the main gonadal bundle and another , which ran parallel to this and projected along almost the same axis but  <START:problem>  slightly obliquely into the sigmoid colon  <END>  on that side . These were not perivasal veins , and the vas was kept well away from where the vascular supply would be clipped .  <START:test>  Two ports  <END>  were placed on the right side , in  <START:problem>  the midclavicular line  <END>  , both of which were infraumbilical , one of which is at the level of the superior iliac crest , the other which was more superiorly positioned just below the level of the umbilicus . Two more ports were placed . The bowel was swept superiorly after being grasped and  <START:treatment>  peritoneal reflection  <END>  taken down with  <START:treatment>  selective cautery  <END>  .
The peritoneal envelope was then opened above the 2 vascular bundles . These were dissected away from the retroperitoneal tissues using blunt dissection and  <START:treatment>  selective cautery  <END>  on the smaller vessels where need be . The main vascular bundle including artery and vein , which was quite impressive in size , were doubly clipped proximally and distally . The area was then incised with  <START:treatment>  the cautery scissors  <END>  and transected . The more medial bundle , which projected into and appeared to end into the sigmoid mesentery was similarly mobilized and clipped . Again , the vas was kept well away from this area of  <START:problem>  dissection  <END>  . The 2 lateral ports were closed using 5-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl subcuticular stitch  <END>  . The infraumbilical port site was closed using 5-0 Vicryl on the skin and subcuticular stitch . The infraumbilical port site was closed with  <START:treatment>  a fascial stitch  <END>  using 3-0 Vicryl .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were applied to each of the sites and  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  0 . 25 % solution was injected in the area .
 <START:test>  A cotton ball  <END>  was applied to  <START:problem>  the umbilical wound  <END>  . This was covered with  <START:problem>  OpSite  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a vacuum seal  <END>  delivered . Of note ,  <START:treatment>  an NG tube  <END>  was placed before insufflation .  <START:problem>  The bladder  <END>  was also emptied with  <START:treatment>  a catheter  <END>  and the young man was placed in  <START:problem>  Trendelenburg position and pressure  <END>  was applied on the varicocele in order to decompress it .

OB history : The patient is  <START:problem>  nulliparous  <END>  . The patient was advised to undergo  <START:treatment>  a LEEP procedure  <END>  with  <START:problem>  ECC  <END>  . All risks and benefits were discussed with the patient including potential risk of  <START:problem>  preterm labor  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  cervical incompetence  <END>  and  <START:problem>  preterm premature rupture of membranes  <END>  should she become  <START:problem>  pregnant  <END>  in the future . The patient accepted these risks . All questions were answered and the patient was taken to the operating room in stable condition . 

PERTINENT FINDINGS :  <START:test>  Bimanual examination  <END>  revealed a normal sized midline uterus with no  <START:problem>  adnexal masses  <END>  palpated . Cervix did not appear to have  <START:problem>  any gross masses  <END>  .  <START:test>  Lugol 's solution  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  areas of non-uptake  <END>  around the entire squamocolumnar junction . SPECIMENS : Ectocervix with anterior and posterior portions , endocervical specimen from the top hat ,  <START:treatment>  endocervical curettings  <END>  .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal .  <START:treatment>  IV FLUIDS  <END>  : 600 mL of lactated Ringer 's . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was taken to the OR where she was placed under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . She was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and placed in  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  .  <START:test>  A preoperative bimanual examination  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  findings  <END>  as above .  <START:treatment>  A preoperative beta quantitative test  <END>  was negative for  <START:problem>  pregnancy  <END>  as well .
At this time ,  <START:problem>  the large Graves speculum  <END>  was placed in the vagina .  <START:test>  Lugol 's solution  <END>  was painted along the entire cervix and  <START:problem>  vaginal wall  <END>  . Areas of non-uptake were noted to be around the entire squamocolumnar junction . Approximately 20 mL of diluted  <START:treatment>  vasopressin  <END>  was injected circumferentially along the cervix .  <START:treatment>  The large loop electrode  <END>  was used to remove  <START:problem>  the anterior or top portion of the cervix  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a separate posterior specimen  <END>  was excised and sent to  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  . The smallest loop electrode was used to obtain a top hat for  <START:treatment>  excision of the endocervix  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  An endocervical curettage  <END>  was performed and specimen was placed on  <START:problem>  a Telfa pad  <END>  and sent to  <START:problem>  pathology  <END>  . The bed of  <START:treatment>  the excised cervical tissue along the cervix  <END>  was cauterized using the roller ball .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was noted .  <START:treatment>  All instruments  <END>  were removed from vagina at this point .

OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Left ankle open reduction  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  internal fixation  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , DPM ANESTHESIA : General . PATHOLOGY : None . HEMOSTASIS :  <START:treatment>  Left pneumatic thigh tourniquet set  <END>  at 300 mmHg .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Less than 15 mL . MATERIALS : 3 . 5 mm cortical screws x4 , 4 . 0  <START:treatment>  mm cancellous screws  <END>  x3 , 22  <START:treatment>  gauge surgical steel wire  <END>  , 1 / 3 tibial plate 6 holes and 0 . 062  <START:treatment>  inch K wires  <END>  x2 . INJECTABLES : 20 mL of 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine plain  <END>  injected in a common peroneal and  <START:problem>  popliteal block fashion  <END>  . COMPLICATIONS : None .
 <START:problem>  DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION  <END>  :  <START:treatment>  Under mild IV sedation  <END>  , the patient was wheeled back into the operating room and placed on the operating table in the supine position .  <START:treatment>  A left pneumatic thigh tourniquet  <END>  was placed about  <START:problem>  the patient 's left thigh  <END>  . The left lower extremity was then scrubbed , prepped and draped in the usual aseptic manner . The lower extremity was elevated and exsanguinated using  <START:treatment>  an Esmarch bandage  <END>  . The tourniquet was then inflated . Attention was then directed to the lateral aspect of the patient 's left leg where approximately a 7 cm to  <START:problem>  8 cm linear incision  <END>  was made overlying the patient 's fibula .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was deepened down in a layered fashion through  <START:problem>  skin and subcutaneous layers  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  superficial and deep fascia  <END>  and  <START:problem>  periosteum  <END>  utilizing a combination of  <START:problem>  sharp and blunt dissection  <END>  . Care was taken to retract  <START:test>  all vital neurovascular structures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  All bleeders  <END>  were cauterized and ligated as necessary . Once down to the level of the periosteum ,  <START:problem>  an incision  <END>  was then made overlying the periosteum of the fibula and  <START:problem>  the periosteum  <END>  was reflected off the fibula utilizing a key elevator . Once this was accomplished ,  <START:problem>  the spiral oblique fracture of the left fibula  <END>  was visualized and consistent with  <START:test>  the previous x-rays  <END>  . Utilizing  <START:treatment>  a curette  <END>  and irrigation with  <START:problem>  normal sterile saline , the fracture site  <END>  was debrided of  <START:problem>  any fibrous clot  <END>  that had formed or  <START:problem>  small bone fragments  <END>  that were interposed between  <START:problem>  the main fibula pieces  <END>  . Once  <START:problem>  the fracture site  <END>  was essentially cleared out ,  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  was temporarily reduced utilizing  <START:treatment>  bone reduction forceps  <END>  . At this point , clinically ,  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  was reduced and compressed . However ,  <START:test>  intraoperative fluoroscopy  <END>  was also used to visualize the left fibula and  <START:problem>  excellent alignment of the fracture site  <END>  with restoration of the length of the fibula and  <START:treatment>  reduction  <END>  of any angulation or  <START:problem>  rotation  <END>  was noted . At this point , a 3 . 5 mm fully threaded  <START:treatment>  cortical screw  <END>  was placed from anterior and posterior at the angle of 45 degrees to  <START:problem>  the fracture site through the fracture line  <END>  .
This was done utilizing standard AO lag screw technique and  <START:treatment>  the screw  <END>  was tightened down .  <START:problem>  Excellent compression  <END>  was  <START:problem>  noted at the fracture site  <END>  and the alignment and length of the fibula was noted to still be in excellent position and verified utilizing the intraoperative fluoroscopy . Next , utilizing 3 . 5 mm cortical screws proximally and two 4 . 0  <START:treatment>  mm cancellous screw distally  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  a one-third 6-hole tubular plate  <END>  was placed along the lateral aspect of the patient 's left fibula with  <START:problem>  the thirdmost distal hole  <END>  being left empty as it overlaid  <START:problem>  the fracture site  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  interfragmentary screw  <END>  . Care was taken to contour the plate to the natural contour of  <START:problem>  the fibula  <END>  and also to  <START:treatment>  direct the distal cancellous screws  <END>  in  <START:problem>  a slight proximal angulation  <END>  to avoid entering the ankle joint .  <START:test>  Intraoperative fluoroscopy  <END>  was used throughout this process and was checked again after  <START:treatment>  all screws and plate  <END>  was applied . Screws were  <START:test>  deemed proper length  <END>  and plate was fairly adhered to the fibula . The area was then copiously flushed with  <START:problem>  normal sterile saline  <END>  and closed in a layered fashion utilizing 2-0 Vicryl , 3-0 Vicryl and  <START:treatment>  stainless steel surgical staples  <END>  . Attention was then directed to the medial aspect of the patient 's left ankle where  <START:test>  previous x-ray analysis  <END>  showed  <START:problem>  a transverse avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was then made approximately 4-5 cm in  <START:problem>  length linear  <END>  extending from superior to inferior overlying the midline of the medial aspect of  <START:problem>  the distal tibia  <END>  , extending from just distal to the medial malleolus and proximally from there .  <START:problem>  This incision  <END>  was deepened down in a layered fashion . Care was taken to retract  <START:test>  all vital neurovascular structures  <END>  . All bleeders were cauterized or ligated as necessary . Upon visualization of the medial aspect of  <START:problem>  the patient 's left ankle , the fracture  <END>  as noted in  <START:test>  the x-ray  <END>  was visualized intraoperatively . The deltoid ligament was able to be visualized also and noted to be intact .
The fracture site of the medial malleolus was then curetted of  <START:problem>  any blood  <END>  or fibrous clot that had formed since  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  to allow for cleaner interposition of  <START:problem>  the fracture fragments  <END>  . Once  <START:treatment>  the curetting  <END>  was finished ,  <START:problem>  the fracture fragments  <END>  were realigned utilizing  <START:treatment>  bone reduction forceps  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Excellent alignment and compression of the fracture site  <END>  was noted both clinically and also utilizing the intraoperative fluoroscopy . Attention was specifically noted to the ankle joint where no  <START:problem>  intra-articular stepoff  <END>  was noted . Next , utilizing  <START:treatment>  a K-wire driver  <END>  , two 0 . 062 K-wires were driven from distal to proximal slight oblique angle , anterior and posterior and parallel to each other up from the distal medial malleolus into the mid medullary canal of the distal shaft of the left tibia .  <START:test>  Intraoperative fluoroscopy  <END>  was used in multiple planes and noted adequate position of  <START:problem>  these K-wires  <END>  .
Next , having  <START:problem>  the periosteum  <END>  reflected off the distal medial aspect of  <START:problem>  the patient 's left tibia proximal to the fracture site  <END>  , a 4 . 0  <START:treatment>  cancellous screw  <END>  was inserted from medial to lateral perpendicular to the long axis of  <START:treatment>  the tibia  <END>  , approximately 2 to 3 cm proximal to the fracture site . The screw was inserted to aid in  <START:treatment>  the tension band fixation  <END>  , which was in the process of being accomplished . Next , utilizing 22  <START:treatment>  gauge surgical stainless steel wire  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  tension band fixation  <END>  was accomplished , utilizing  <START:treatment>  a figure-of-eight maneuver hooking the wire  <END>  around the proximal screw and distally around the 2 K-wires .  <START:treatment>  The cerclage wire  <END>  was then tightened down both anteriorly and posteriorly between the distal and proximal aspects of it utilizing  <START:test>  a twisting motion  <END>  . Upon tightening of  <START:treatment>  the cerclage wire  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  compression  <END>  was noted across  <START:problem>  the medial malleolar fracture site  <END>  . The twisted crimped portion of  <START:treatment>  the wire  <END>  was then cut and shortened with  <START:treatment>  care  <END>  noted to keep the compression at  <START:problem>  these 2 sites  <END>  . 
They were then bent back down and partially buried into the cortex of the medial aspect of the distal tibia to keep from being prominent underlying the skin . Next , the distal aspect of  <START:treatment>  the K-wires  <END>  were cut short , bent at an acute angle and buried deep into the distal tip of the distal malleolus so as to stay firmly seated and also not to become prominent to the patient postoperatively . Once all the fixation was achieved ,  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  was then copiously irrigated with  <START:treatment>  normal sterile saline  <END>  and closed in layered fashion utilizing 2-0 Vicryl , 3-0 Vicryl and  <START:treatment>  surgical stainless steel staples  <END>  . Final intraoperative fluoroscopy was then undertaken and  <START:problem>  excellent alignment of the ankle joint  <END>  with  <START:problem>  compression  <END>  of  <START:problem>  both medial and lateral fracture sites  <END>  and  <START:problem>  alignment of the fracture fragment  <END>  was noted . Dressings were then applied consisting of  <START:treatment>  Adaptic  <END>  , 4 x 4s , Kling ,  <START:problem>  Kerlix  <END>  and sterile Webril .  <START:treatment>  The tourniquet  <END>  was deflated and prompt capillary response was noted to the left lower extremity .
Next ,  <START:treatment>  a multi-layer dressing consisting of cast padding  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Ace bandages  <END>  were placed about to the patient 's left leg distal to the patient 's knee .  <START:treatment>  A 5 inch posterior fiberglass splint  <END>  was placed along  <START:problem>  the patient 's posterior left leg  <END>  with care taken to keep the foot at 90 degrees . Also ,  <START:treatment>  a U-shaped 4-inch fiberglass splint  <END>  was placed from medial to lateral in a stirrup fashion for  <START:treatment>  additional support  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Additional Ace bandages  <END>  were placed over the fiberglass splint to keep them in place . Next , the above-mentioned cocktail was injected into the patient 's left peroneal area and popliteal area for  <START:treatment>  distal anesthesia  <END>  to  <START:treatment>  the patient 's left leg  <END>  . The patient was then sent to recovery where she will be monitored for a sufficient period of time before being re-admitted back to the floor .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA :  <START:treatment>  General endotracheal tube anesthesia  <END>  . COMPLICATIONS : None .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . DRAINS : None . SPECIMENS : None . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was placed supine on the operating table . After adequate IV access and  <START:treatment>  IV sedation  <END>  , the patient was  <START:treatment>  intubated  <END>  and anesthetized .  <START:treatment>  Foley catheter  <END>  was placed by myself and the bladder was distended with 300 mL of  <START:treatment>  Kantrex solution  <END>  .  <START:test>  A urine culture  <END>  was taken previously to the Kantrex . The abdomen was prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine solution  <END>  and draped with sterile linen and  <START:treatment>  sterile drapes  <END>  .
 <START:problem>  A right lower quadrant curvilinear incision  <END>  was created with  <START:treatment>  a 10 blade scalpel  <END>  and extended down through the oblique fascial levels .  <START:treatment>  The external and internal oblique fascia  <END>  was elevated laterally and the iliac fossa was now entered .  <START:test>  The peritoneum and its contents  <END>  were mobilized medially and  <START:problem>  cephalad  <END>  . The iliac fossa was entered .  <START:problem>  Bookwalter retracting system  <END>  was set up for visualization of  <START:problem>  retraction  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Numerous lymph nodes encased the external iliac artery  <END>  from the spermatic cord up to the bifurcation . These were excised and ligated with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk ligatures  <END>  as needed . The epigastric vessels were circumferentially dissected , ligated . The spermatic cord was attempted to be saved ; however , was rather short and the external iliac artery and vein were unable to be mobilized and visualized without dividing the cord . The cord was tied with 0  <START:treatment>  silk ties  <END>  x 2 and divided between  <START:treatment>  the ligatures  <END>  . The extensor iliac artery and vein were now circumferentially dissected and  <START:problem>  vessel loops  <END>  were placed for control .
With  <START:problem>  the kidney appropriate  <END>  for  <START:problem>  explantation  <END>  making 200 mL every 10 minutes or so ,  <START:problem>  the kidney  <END>  was removed from the donor in the donor room , placed on  <START:treatment>  ice  <END>  and passed off to myself . The kidney was taken to the back table in the recipient room and  <START:treatment>  the staple lines  <END>  were removed from the vein and the artery and the kidney was flushed with 250 mL of  <START:problem>  cold UW solution  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  heparin  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The renal artery  <END>  and renal vein were now mobilized up to the first bifurcations . Tributaries were ligated with  <START:treatment>  4-0 silk ligatures  <END>  on the vein and divided as needed .  <START:problem>  All extraneous fatty tissues  <END>  were removed .  <START:problem>  Gerota fascia  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Gerota fat  <END>  removed as well . The ureter was preserved with  <START:test>  its blood supply in its full length  <END>  . The kidney flushed well and a couple of superficial veins on the surface did not  <START:problem>  flush  <END>  , but the rest of it was rather well flushed and the effluent from the vein was clear . With  <START:treatment>  the kidney now prepared  <END>  , it was brought up to the surgical field .
The renal vein was measured for  <START:problem>  its diameter  <END>  . The external vein was occluded both proximally and distally and  <START:treatment>  a venotomy  <END>  was created with  <START:treatment>  an 11 blade scalpel  <END>  and extended with  <START:treatment>  Potts scissors  <END>  to the appropriate length . The renal vein was anastomosed to the external iliac vein in an end-to-side fashion with  <START:problem>  double-armed  <END>  6-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene sutures  <END>  . With  <START:treatment>  the vein anastomosis  <END>  now complete ,  <START:treatment>  a bulldog clamp  <END>  was placed within the hilum on the renal vein and  <START:problem>  the occlusion  <END>  of  <START:problem>  the external iliac  <END>  removed re-establishing flow back from the leg .  <START:treatment>  The anastomosis  <END>  was  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  . The external iliac artery was now occluded both distally and proximally with  <START:problem>  atraumatic vascular clamps  <END>  . The renal artery was measured for  <START:problem>  its diameter in its location  <END>  . The external iliac artery had  <START:problem>  an arteriotomy  <END>  created with  <START:problem>  an 11 blade scalpel  <END>  where the artery fit best and would not be stretched or kinked . This arteriotomy was extended with  <START:treatment>  Potts scissors  <END>  .
The renal artery was anastomosed to the external iliac artery in  <START:problem>  an end-to-side fashion  <END>  with two double-armed 6-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene sutures  <END>  in a simple running fashion . The renal artery was now  <START:problem>  occluded  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The occlusion of the distal external iliac artery  <END>  and then the proximal were now opened up to flush all debris down into the leg . With everything now opened to and from the leg ,  <START:problem>  the renal artery  <END>  and renal vein were opened to flow . The kidney pinked up immediately . It was bathed in  <START:treatment>  hot saline to break vasoconstriction  <END>  . There were no areas that did not perfuse and  <START:test>  the kidney started making urine  <END>  within an hour of  <START:treatment>  reperfusion  <END>  . The time between clamping the renal vessels in the donor and  <START:problem>  flushing  <END>  was 1 minute 45 seconds and the time of  <START:problem>  anastomosis  <END>  was 25 minutes . With the kidney now well perfused , not quite making urine yet ,  <START:test>  the kidney  <END>  was placed in the iliac fossa so that the vessels were nonoccluded . The bladder was exposed .  <START:treatment>  The perivesicular tissues  <END>  were divided with electrocautery down to the muscular wall of the bladder . The bladder wall was opened dividing the muscle fibers down to the mucosa . The mucosa was opened with  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  to the appropriate length . The ureter was now cut to custom  <START:test>  length  <END>  . The vessels within this mesentery were ligated with 4-0  <START:treatment>  silk ligature  <END>  and the ureter was spatulated on its back wall . The ureter was now anastomosed to the bladder in a mucosa-mucosa technique creating neocystostomy with  <START:problem>  double-armed  <END>  5-0  <START:treatment>  Maxon sutures  <END>  . After completion of  <START:problem>  the ureteral neocystostomy  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  was visualized and inspected . We were unhappy with  <START:test>  its length  <END>  and were afraid that the tie of the vascular components of the ureteral mesentry was impinging on the heel of  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The anastomosis  <END>  was taken down . The ureter was recut . This was re-spatulated to a larger length .

Patient was admitted for  <START:treatment>  a routine surgery  <END>  on Thursday . He had  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  overnight and was transferred to the ICU . The bladder was freshened out and  <START:treatment>  the ureteroneocystostomy  <END>  was recreated with 2 double-armed 5-0  <START:treatment>  Maxon sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The anastomosis  <END>  was adequate and much more secured .  <START:problem>  The bladder wall  <END>  was brought over toe of  <START:problem>  the anastomosis  <END>  with 2 interrupted 4-0  <START:treatment>  Maxon sutures  <END>  reapproximating but not occluding  <START:problem>  the anastomosis  <END>  . The anastomosis of the artery and vein and  <START:problem>  all dissection planes  <END>  were evaluated and found to be  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  . All layers were irrigated with  <START:treatment>  Kantrex solution  <END>  and aspirated dry .  <START:problem>  The kidney  <END>  was placed into the iliac fossa so that the vessels were straight but not on  <START:problem>  tension  <END>  . The ureter was not on  <START:problem>  tension  <END>  but also was not kinked .  <START:test>  The peritoneum and its contents  <END>  were brought up over the kidney to hold it in place . The muscular abdominal wall was closed in a 2-layer fashion with  <START:treatment>  # 1 Prolene simple running suture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Subcutaneous tissues  <END>  were irrigated with  <START:treatment>  Kantrex solution  <END>  .The Scarpa layer was brought together with 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl running suture  <END>  and the skin was reapproximated with 4-0  <START:treatment>  subcuticular suture  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well and was taken to the recovery room in awake and stable condition making approximately 175 mL of urine every half hour .

There was normal anterior fundal placenta . 
 <START:problem>  The amniotic fluid  <END>  was clear . The uterus ,  <START:treatment>  fallopian tubes  <END>  and ovaries were normal . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating suite in stable condition with  <START:treatment>  epidural anesthesia  <END>  on  <START:treatment>  board  <END>  and  <START:problem>  an indwelling catheter in place in the bladder  <END>  . The patient was placed supine on the operating room table and rolled to her left side with a wedge . The abdomen was prepped and draped in standard fashion for  <START:treatment>  cesarean section  <END>  . After testing with  <START:treatment>  forceps  <END>  to assure  <START:problem>  an adequate anesthetic level  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  was commenced . We had counseled the patient extensively regarding the risks of  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  including but not limited to  <START:problem>  stroke  <END>  , embolus ,  <START:problem>  phlebitis  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  infection  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  hemorrhage  <END>  , as well as injury to the infant and  <START:problem>  the internal organs  <END>  such as the bowel , bladder ,  <START:problem>  blood vessels  <END>  , nerves , kidneys ,  <START:problem>  ureters and pelvic organs  <END>  . The patient was aware of  <START:problem>  the postoperative morbidity issues  <END>  and recovery timeframes .
The patient was aware she can form  <START:problem>  adhesions  <END>  , which can result in obstruction of loop of bowel or ureter or  <START:problem>  chronic pain  <END>  . She was aware that should she have  <START:problem>  hemorrhage  <END>  and require  <START:treatment>  blood transfusion  <END>  , there was a small chance for  <START:treatment>  exposure  <END>  to  <START:problem>  hepatitis  <END>  or  <START:problem>  HIV disease  <END>  . With  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  a Pfannenstiel skin incision  <END>  was made .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was carried down sharply through the subcutaneous tissues and fascia in a transverse plane with  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  electrocautery  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  curved Mayo scissors  <END>  . The fascia was sharply freed up superiorly and inferiorly from the underlying rectus muscles , which were bluntly and sharply divided . The peritoneum was entered carefully in a clear space with  <START:treatment>  a curved hemostat  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The peritoneal incision  <END>  was then extended vertically with  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A retractor and bladder blade  <END>  were placed .  <START:problem>  A bladder flap  <END>  was created by incising transversely through the peritoneum and vesicouterine fold and then bluntly dissecting the bladder distally . With  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  a low transverse hysterotomy  <END>  was commenced . The serosa and myometrium were scored with  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  . The uterine cavity was actually entered bluntly with  <START:treatment>  a curved hemostat  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The uterine incision  <END>  was then extended laterally with  <START:test>  the operator 's fingers  <END>  .  <START:problem>  An intrauterine hand  <END>  was placed and the head of the infant was brought up out of  <START:problem>  the pelvis into the uterine incision  <END>  . With  <START:test>  fundal pressure  <END>  , he was delivered without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . The nasopharynx and oropharynx were suctioned . The cord was doubly clamped and transected . The infant was then handed off to the nursery personnel .  <START:test>  Apgars  <END>  were good at 8 and 9 .  <START:test>  A cord pH  <END>  was obtained , which subsequently revealed a normal value .  <START:test>  Further cord blood  <END>  was collected for  <START:test>  routine testing  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Intravenous Pitocin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  antibiotics  <END>  were administered . The placenta was manually removed . The uterine cavity was then curetted with  <START:treatment>  a dry sponge  <END>  and freed of the remaining membranes . The edges of  <START:problem>  the uterine incision  <END>  were grasped with  <START:treatment>  Pennington clamps  <END>  .
With  <START:treatment>  the massage  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  the Pitocin  <END>  , the uterus began to firm up normally .  <START:problem>  The uterine incision  <END>  was then closed in 2 layers of 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The first suture  <END>  was placed to the endometrium and  <START:problem>  myometrium  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The second suture  <END>  was placed through  <START:problem>  the endopelvic fascia  <END>  and also reincorporated  <START:treatment>  the bladder flap peritoneum  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Peritoneal lavage  <END>  was then performed . The pelvis and gutters were irrigated and suctioned and cleared of  <START:problem>  all blood and clots  <END>  and  <START:problem>  amniotic fluid  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The uterine incision  <END>  was reinspected to assure  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . The uterus , tubes and ovaries were inspected and were normal . Once we were satisfied with  <START:treatment>  the hemostasis  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  attention  <END>  was turned to closure of  <START:problem>  the abdominal incision  <END>  . The peritoneum , muscles and fascia were closed in layers using 0-Vicryl  <START:treatment>  sutures  <END>  . The subcutaneous tissue was closed with 3-0  <START:treatment>  plain sutures  <END>  .

Sample 44

 <START:test>  MRI OF THE LEFT  <END>  HEEL / CALCANEUS WITHOUT CONTRAST HISTORY :  <START:problem>  Heel pain  <END>  , 3 months .  <START:problem>  Soft tissue mass  <END>  , lateral ankle . TECHNIQUE :  <START:problem>  Multiplanar images of the left heel / calcaneus  <END>  were obtained without  <START:test>  contrast  <END>  . The bony structures and articulations are maintained .  <START:problem>  The marrow signal  <END>  within the bony structures is unremarkable . There is no  <START:problem>  obvious fracture  <END>  or  <START:problem>  dislocation  <END>  .  <START:test>  The Achilles tendon does  <END>  have  <START:problem>  some increased signal intensity  <END>  within it on the T2 and T1 weighted sequences . Additionally , there is  <START:problem>  some fluid along the medial anterior aspect of the Achilles tendon  <END>  . This combination of findings may represent  <START:problem>  partial tear to the Achilles tendon  <END>  . The marker is placed posterolaterally . In this area , there is  <START:treatment>  some focal fat  <END>  . Anterior to the marker , the peroneus longus and  <START:problem>  brevis tendons  <END>  are located . Overall , the peroneus tendons appear intact . They may have  <START:problem>  minimal fluid adjacent  <END>  to them that could represent  <START:problem>  tendinitis  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  abnormal increased signal within the peroneus tendons  <END>  , however .
There is  <START:problem>  some fluid anterolateral to the flexor hallucis longus muscle  <END>  / tendon . This fluid appears to extend posterior to the talus and in the posterior talofibular joint space . The muscles and tendons are otherwise preserved . No  <START:problem>  other large fluid collections  <END>  identified . IMPRESSION : 1 . Achilles tendon is notable for  <START:problem>  slight increased signal  <END>  as well as  <START:problem>  fluid adjacent to Achilles tendon  <END>  . The combination of findings may represent  <START:problem>  a partial tear  <END>  or  <START:problem>  tendinosis  <END>  . 2 . The marker is placed posterolaterally in the area of fat . It is lateral to the Achilles tendon and posterior to the peroneus longus and  <START:problem>  brevis tendons  <END>  . There is  <START:problem>  some slight fluid adjacent to the peroneus tendon  <END>  that may represent  <START:problem>  some mild tendinosis  <END>  or  <START:problem>  tenosynovitis  <END>  . 3 . There is  <START:problem>  some fluid along the anterolateral aspect of flexor hallucis  <END>  longus muscle and tendon that appears to extend posteriorly in the region of the talofibular joint .
 <START:test>  MRI OF THE BRAIN WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST HISTORY  <END>  :  <START:problem>  Numbness  <END>  and  <START:problem>  head pain  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Multiplanar images of the brain  <END>  were obtained without and with contrast . There is  <START:problem>  right maxillary mucosal thickening  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a narrow fluid level  <END>  posteriorly , rather small but they represent  <START:problem>  some acute sinusitis  <END>  . The ventricles are symmetric . There is no  <START:problem>  mass  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  mass effect  <END>  or  <START:problem>  shift to midline structures  <END>  . With  <START:problem>  contrast  <END>  , there is no  <START:problem>  abnormal enhancing lesion  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  extra-axial fluid collection  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  obvious infarct  <END>  . IMPRESSION : There is  <START:problem>  right maxillary mucosal thickening  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a small area of fluid level  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Some sinusitis  <END>  on the right is not excluded . The remainder of the brain without contrast and with contrast is unremarkable .  <START:test>  MRI  <END>  Sample Reports -  <START:test>  Various MRI OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER WITHOUT CONTRAST  <END>  HISTORY : The patient had  <START:problem>  focal trauma  <END>  to the upper arm .
We see a large , approximately  <START:problem>  1 cm cystic structure at the superolateral humeral head near the attachment site  <END>  , which is on the tendon . Directly adjacent to that  <START:problem>  distal supraspinatus tendon  <END>  , we do see abnormal signal of the tendon anteriorly and  <START:treatment>  loss of clear tendon fiber definition near the attachment  <END>  . This could indicate  <START:problem>  a full-thickness tear  <END>  of a few fibers of  <START:test>  the supraspinatus tendon  <END>  or  <START:problem>  a significant partial tear  <END>  with  <START:problem>  tendinosis  <END>  . The remaining aspect of the supraspinatus tendon is intact without significant retraction .  <START:problem>  The AC joint does show some moderate hypertrophy  <END>  with both caudal and cephalad extension . The caudal extension does appear to depress the underlying supraspinatus structure somewhat but does not cause  <START:problem>  significant edema  <END>  to suggest a definite impairment radiographically . We do see  <START:problem>  a tear of the distal subscapularis tendon in the mid section  <END>  .
No  <START:problem>  full-thickness retraction  <END>  is noted in this area . It is most likely  <START:problem>  an intratendon tear  <END>  . It extends about 1 . 5 cm retrograde from the insertion site . There is a question of  <START:problem>  some bruising  <END>  and possible  <START:problem>  mild medial dislocation  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The subscapularis tendon  <END>  is not completely torn ; however , it corresponds to complete  <START:problem>  dislocation medially  <END>  , but there is  <START:problem>  some edema  <END>  around that area of the biceps tendon inferiorly as this is felt to cross across the humeral head . Besides  <START:problem>  the cystic change in the superolateral humeral head  <END>  , there is no  <START:problem>  other focal contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  microfracture  <END>  that is suggested of  <START:problem>  the humerus  <END>  or the glenoid . The glenoid labrum appears grossly intact on  <START:test>  this exam  <END>  . There is moderate amount of  <START:problem>  joint effusion  <END>  present , which is felt overlying that structure . Infraspinatus and teres minor muscles are intact . The deltoid muscle is intact without  <START:problem>  hematoma  <END>  or  <START:problem>  tearing  <END>  . There is  <START:problem>  a fluid collection in the subscapularis recess  <END>  .
IMPRESSION : 1 . There is  <START:problem>  a 1 cm cystic change noted at the superolateral humeral head near the anterior supraspinatus contusion site  <END>  and  <START:problem>  some signal changes of the distal supraspinatus tendon  <END>  near the anterior aspect of its course . There is suggestion of  <START:problem>  a significant probable partial tear  <END>  and  <START:problem>  tendinosis  <END>  in this area . No  <START:problem>  significant tendon retraction  <END>  is noted of the supraspinatus structure . 2 .  <START:problem>  Moderate degenerative change of the AC joint  <END>  with  <START:problem>  some mild inferior and superior inflammation  <END>  within the joint . 3 .  <START:problem>  A moderately significant intrasubstance tear  <END>  is suggestive of the subscapularis tendon . No  <START:problem>  full-thickness tear  <END>  or  <START:problem>  contracture  <END>  is noted . 4 .  <START:problem>  Abnormal high signal of the more superior portion  <END>  of the biceps tendon is also suggested and its pathway is not as clear once this crosses superiorly and if it is crossed across the humeral head .  <START:problem>  A mild subluxation  <END>  of this position could be present .
 <START:test>  LEFT SHOULDER MRI  <END>  :  <START:test>  Left shoulder MRI  <END>  is performed in the usual fashion . There are  <START:problem>  numerous areas of high signal involving the superolateral humeral head  <END>  . There is  <START:problem>  a small cortical disruption  <END>  indicating a partial or  <START:problem>  nondisplaced complete fracture  <END>  involving the superolateral component of  <START:problem>  the humeral head  <END>  . There is  <START:problem>  edema  <END>  in this area . The overlying supraspinatus tendon does not show evidence of  <START:problem>  significant edema  <END>  . No evidence of  <START:problem>  tearing  <END>  or  <START:problem>  retraction  <END>  . The area of  <START:problem>  abnormality involves the bony structures itself  <END>  . The biceps tendon remains in the normal location .  <START:problem>  A small amount of fluid  <END>  is noted around it .  <START:problem>  The subscapularis  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  remaining rotator cuff tendons  <END>  are intact and in normal position .
The AC joint shows  <START:problem>  some moderate hypertrophy  <END>  with both superior and  <START:treatment>  caudal bony spur extension  <END>  . This does not appear to  <START:problem>  significantly impress the underlying supraspinatus structures  <END>  but that would need to be correlated to  <START:test>  the clinical examination  <END>  . IMPRESSION : 1 .  <START:problem>  Partial or nondisplaced complete fracture of the superolateral humeral head  <END>  is suggested with  <START:problem>  surrounding edema  <END>  . No involvement of  <START:treatment>  the overlying rotator cuff tendons  <END>  is present . The biceps tendon remains intact . 2 . No  <START:problem>  bony contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  irregularity of the glenoid bony structure  <END>  is definitely seen .  <START:treatment>  MRI OF THE RIGHT UPPER ARM  <END>  On  <START:test>  this exam  <END>  , 5 views were taken using coronal and  <START:test>  sagittal imaging  <END>  . The humerus is intact . No  <START:problem>  fractures  <END>  are noted . No  <START:problem>  contusions of the bony structures  <END>  or  <START:problem>  cortical breakage  <END>  .
The musculature of the triceps , biceps and brachialis structures are all intact without evidence of  <START:problem>  seroma  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  muscle contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  obvious muscle retraction  <END>  . No evidence of  <START:treatment>  obvious tendon tears  <END>  in this area is noted . IMPRESSION :  <START:test>  MRI of the right humerus  <END>  shows no evidence of  <START:problem>  bony deficits  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  breakage  <END>  and no  <START:problem>  gross abnormalities  <END>  to the muscular structures of the arm as well .  <START:test>  MRI OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST Multiplanar images of the abdomen  <END>  and pelvis were obtained without and with contrast .  <START:test>  MRI OF THE ABDOMEN  <END>  There is  <START:problem>  a large fluid collection in the left upper quadrant  <END>  measuring 7 . 5 cm transverse x 7 . 2 cm craniocaudal x approximately 9 .  <START:test>  2 cm AP dimensions  <END>  . This appears to be fluid as it is  <START:problem>  low signal on T1  <END>  and high signal on T2 . It is superior to the left kidney , seen along the posterior aspect of the left kidney , inferior to the spleen .
This could represent  <START:problem>  postsurgical fluid collection  <END>  . Possibly , it could be  <START:problem>  a cyst  <END>  ; however , this is less likely given its appearance . The right kidney has 2 cysts in the upper pole , one anterior and one lateral . The left kidney has a less than 1 cm cyst anteriorly involving the upper pole . The ureters appear normal in course and caliber . No  <START:problem>  other focal lesions  <END>  are identified involving the kidneys . The adrenal glands appear grossly unremarkable . With  <START:problem>  contrast  <END>  , there are no  <START:problem>  abnormal enhancing lesions  <END>  . IMPRESSION : 1 . There is  <START:problem>  a large fluid collection in the left upper quadrant inferior to the spleen  <END>  , superior to the kidney , posteriorly located , that is quite large . This could be  <START:problem>  a postop seroma  <END>  or  <START:problem>  evolving hemorrhagic collection  <END>  . It possibly could be  <START:problem>  a renal cyst  <END>  . 2 .  <START:problem>  Bilateral renal cysts  <END>  , 2 on the right and 1 on the left . 3 . There is no  <START:problem>  abnormal enhancing lesion  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  other lesions  <END>  are identified .
 <START:test>  MRI OF THE PELVIS Multiplanar images of the pelvis  <END>  were obtained . The bladder has loose walls . There is no  <START:problem>  obvious mass involving the bladder  <END>  . Bony structures are intact . Muscle bundles are preserved . No other  <START:problem>  abnormal mass  <END>  or  <START:problem>  fluid collections  <END>  are identified . IMPRESSION : There is no  <START:problem>  abnormal enhancing lesion  <END>  . Bladder is unremarkable . No  <START:problem>  masses  <END>  identified .  <START:test>  MRI SCAN OF THE RIGHT HAND CLINICAL HISTORY  <END>  :  <START:problem>  Acute injury  <END>  . Marker has been placed at the indicated complaint site , which is overlying the dorsum of the hand and wrist at the level of the base of  <START:problem>  the third metacarpal and underlying capitate  <END>  . Evaluation of the osseus structures showed  <START:problem>  intact metacarpal bones  <END>  numbering 1 through 5 without findings of  <START:problem>  any specific occult-type fracture  <END>  or  <START:problem>  obvious bone contusion  <END>  . Evaluation of  <START:problem>  the carpal bones  <END>  , especially at the complaint site , shows normal appearance and contour of  <START:problem>  the capitate carpal bone  <END>  .
Adjacent hamate as well as the hook of the hamate appear intact . Pisiform and both the greater and lesser multangulars also appear intact . Carpal navicular does not exhibit any  <START:problem>  specific abnormal signal change  <END>  or  <START:problem>  fracture  <END>  . Lunate is in normal position and normal appearance .  <START:problem>  Distal radius  <END>  and ulna are also unremarkable . The coronal and axial T2 weighted images show  <START:problem>  several focal collections  <END>  of  <START:problem>  fluid  <END>  , notably in the radial scaphoid space . This may reflect some component of  <START:problem>  injury to the hyaline cartilage  <END>  within this joint space , also  <START:problem>  small focal amount of fluid within the radioulnar space  <END>  . Evaluation of  <START:test>  the triangular fibrocartilage  <END>  in this region does not highlight any  <START:problem>  specific gross abnormality  <END>  . These are not dedicated images of the wrist however . Also some amount of  <START:problem>  free fluid surrounding the pisiform bone  <END>  . No findings of  <START:problem>  any obvious dislocation  <END>  . IMPRESSION : Marker indicates complaint overlying the region of the base of  <START:problem>  the third metacarpal and capitate  <END>  .
No clear indication of  <START:problem>  any underlying bone contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  occult-type fracture involving the metacarpal bones  <END>  and their articulation with the distal row of  <START:problem>  carpal bones  <END>  . There are  <START:problem>  focal areas of fluid collection  <END>  as mentioned above , which may indicate some component of  <START:problem>  injury to the hyaline cartilages  <END>  or perhaps the intercarpal ligaments , not readily apparent . There appears to be  <START:problem>  more fluid collection surrounding pisiform  <END>  and appearing between the radioulnar space ; however , the triangular fibrocartilage appears grossly intact . The patient does not exhibit any  <START:problem>  specific pain  <END>  over this region .  <START:test>  Knee MRI Sample Reports MRI OF THE RIGHT ANKLE HISTORY  <END>  : History of  <START:problem>  ankle pain  <END>  .  <START:test>  Routine imaging  <END>  was performed in all 3 orthogonal planes . We see a small area of  <START:problem>  degenerative disk of the inferior posterior tibial plafond  <END>  . This articulates to the tibiotalar joint . There is also  <START:problem>  a focal deficit seen in the superior lateral tibial plateau  <END>  indicating an area of  <START:problem>  contusion  <END>  and  <START:problem>  proximal microfractures  <END>  .
This suggest  <START:problem>  some mild high signal  <END>  on T2 and low signal on T1 indicating some  <START:problem>  acute edema in the area  <END>  .  <START:test>  The sagittal images  <END>  do suggest on T1 weighted some demarcation lines indicating what may be  <START:treatment>  a developing osteochondral defect  <END>  involving the superolateral talar dome . Dome and joint bodies in the tibial talar joint spaces are noted . We do see also some irregular markings of the distal talus involving the anterior and dorsal aspect .  <START:treatment>  The demarcation lines  <END>  are suggesting  <START:problem>  some probable microfractures  <END>  and  <START:problem>  edema  <END>  in this region . This could be related to  <START:problem>  prior trauma  <END>  and simply not completely healed . With regards to soft tissues , we do see  <START:problem>  some small fluid between the lateral aspect of the talonavicular joint region  <END>  and the extensor digitorum brevis muscle . No  <START:problem>  significant tearing  <END>  of the muscle is noted . The fluid is apparent between  <START:problem>  these 2 structures  <END>  and one image suggests  <START:problem>  a very small contusion of the navicular bones  <END>  in that area . We also see  <START:problem>  some fluid  <END>  around the flexor hallucis longus tendon .
This is seen as it wraps around the tibia that extends anteriorly . We see some thickening of the more anterior component , which may indicate that it has been injured in the past and has repaired itself . There was no  <START:problem>  fluid within the tendon proper  <END>  to indicate  <START:problem>  a partial tear tendinosis  <END>  at the time , but there may be  <START:problem>  a small synovial inflammation as the fluid  <END>  around the tendon is slightly greater than normally seen . Again , no partial or  <START:problem>  complete acute tear  <END>  is noted . No  <START:problem>  tears of the peroneus tendons  <END>  or  <START:problem>  posterior tibialis  <END>  tendon were definitely seen on  <START:test>  this exam  <END>  . Small amount of  <START:problem>  fluid  <END>  is noted in the sinus tarsi . IMPRESSION : 1 . There is  <START:problem>  a very small signal change noted at the superolateral talar dome  <END>  , which presents as  <START:problem>  low on T1  <END>  and higher on  <START:problem>  T2 suggesting edema  <END>  . T1 does suggest well-demarcated lines that represent  <START:problem>  a small osteochondral defect  <END>  ; it may be forming in this region . No  <START:problem>  loose joint bodies in the tibiotalar joint spaces  <END>  noted .

There are  <START:problem>  some small degenerative cysts  <END>  noted of  <START:test>  the posterior tibial plafond  <END>  , may indicate  <START:problem>  degenerative  <END>  or perhaps old changes to that region . 3 . There are  <START:problem>  some signal changes also of the distal anterior talus  <END>  near the dorsal aspect of the talonavicular joint space . This area of  <START:problem>  high signal  <END>  suggests  <START:problem>  some contusion  <END>  or  <START:problem>  microfracture  <END>  . No malalignment of  <START:problem>  a full fracture  <END>  is present . 4 . There is fluid around the flexor hallucis longus tendon indicating what may be  <START:problem>  synovitis  <END>  . It is slightly greater than normally seen . The tendon itself is slightly more thickened . This artifact may represent  <START:problem>  some old partial tears and reparative changes  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  acute tendinosis  <END>  or  <START:problem>  tearing  <END>  is seen . 5 . The capsule indicated an area of  <START:problem>  discomfort  <END>  noted by the extensor digitorum longus tendon and muscle and no  <START:problem>  significant abnormal signal  <END>  or  <START:problem>  unusual masses  <END>  are noted in that area .
 <START:test>  MRI OF THE LEFT  <END>  WRIST : HISTORY : Left wrist /  <START:problem>  forearm mass  <END>  , one year , getting larger .  <START:problem>  Multiplanar images  <END>  were obtained without and with contrast .  <START:problem>  The mass  <END>  follows the fat on all sequences . This does not enhance . This is most suggestive of  <START:problem>  a lipoma  <END>  . This measures 3 . 6 cm craniocaudal dimension x 1 cm transverse x 1 .  <START:test>  6 cm AP dimension  <END>  . It does suppress on  <START:treatment>  the fat suppression technique  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  soft tissue component  <END>  . This corresponds with the marker and is adjacent to the distal radial metadiaphyseal region along the radial aspect . There is incidental note of  <START:problem>  some fluid distal  <END>  to the radial styloid as well as distal to the ulnar styloid .  <START:problem>  The marrow signal  <END>  within the bony structures is unremarkable . IMPRESSION :  <START:problem>  The palpable abnormality corresponds  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a simple lipoma  <END>  as it does follow the signal intensity for  <START:treatment>  fat on all sequences  <END>  and does not enhance . There is no  <START:problem>  soft tissue component  <END>  .
This is located along the radial aspect of  <START:problem>  the distal radial metadiaphyseal region  <END>  . It does suppress on  <START:treatment>  the fat suppression sequences  <END>  as well . No  <START:problem>  other focal lesion  <END>  is identifiable aside from incidental note of  <START:problem>  some fluid distal to the radial styloid  <END>  as well as the ulnar styloid .  <START:test>  MRI OF THE RIGHT SHOULDER  <END>  :  <START:test>  Multiplanar images  <END>  were obtained . There is  <START:problem>  a full-thickness tear of the anterior component  <END>  of  <START:test>  the supraspinatus tendon  <END>  with  <START:problem>  some minimal retraction  <END>  . There are  <START:problem>  degenerative changes involving the AC joint  <END>  with inferior and superior osteophyte formation . There is  <START:problem>  some high signal in the subscapularis tendon  <END>  suggestive of possible  <START:problem>  injury  <END>  with suggestion of  <START:problem>  some partial retraction  <END>  . The glenoid labrum appears grossly intact . Marrow signal within the bony structures is within normal limits . Biceps tendon is well located within the groove . IMPRESSION : 1 .

There is  <START:problem>  suggestion of injury in the subscapularis tendon  <END>  as there is  <START:problem>  some fluid in this area  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Some minimal retraction  <END>  is not excluded  <START:test>  MRI of the Right Knee Sample MRI OF THE HEAD  <END>  : HISTORY :  <START:problem>  Severe headaches  <END>  .  <START:test>  Routine MRI of the head reveals  <END>  no  <START:problem>  suspicious mass  <END>  or  <START:problem>  mass effect  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  midline shift  <END>  . No  <START:problem>  white matter areas of demyelination  <END>  to indicate  <START:problem>  ischemic  <END>  or  <START:problem>  demyelinating disease  <END>  . The brain stem is intact . Craniocervical junction is normal . No  <START:problem>  pathology within either of the globes  <END>  of the eye are noted nor within the retrobulbar region . We do see that there is  <START:problem>  some right circumferential maxillary sinus disease  <END>  and  <START:problem>  left circumferential frontal disease  <END>  . In addition , there is  <START:problem>  some bilateral ethmoid disease of the sinuses  <END>  . IMPRESSION : 1 .

On  <START:test>  the FLAIR sequences  <END>  , there is  <START:problem>  a round area of high signal  <END>  on the right adjacent to the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle measuring about 5 mm . Superiorly is  <START:problem>  a low signal on T1 weighted images  <END>  . It was not enhanced with  <START:test>  contrast  <END>  . This may represent  <START:problem>  a minimal area of small vessel / ischemic-type disease  <END>  , possible  <START:problem>  MS  <END>  , also  <START:problem>  minimal cystic / encephalomalacic-type change  <END>  .

There is  <START:problem>  a 5 mm area of high signal  <END>  on the T2 weighted sequences and minimally on  <START:treatment>  the FLAIR  <END>  sequences on the right along the anterolateral aspect of the clivus . Could be  <START:problem>  some cystic change in the inferior aspect of the right sphenoid sinus  <END>  /  <START:problem>  mucosal thickening  <END>  . Visualized sinuses are otherwise clear . No  <START:problem>  abnormal enhancing lesion  <END>  is identified . IMPRESSION : 1 .  <START:problem>  A 5 mm area of high signal  <END>  on  <START:problem>  the T2  <END>  weighted sequences on the right anterolateral to the clivus could represent  <START:problem>  some mucosal thickening in the inferior aspect of the right sphenoid sinus  <END>  . 2 . The 4-5 mm area of  <START:problem>  high signal in the periventricular white matter  <END>  on the right adjacent to the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle could represent  <START:problem>  small vessel  <END>  /  <START:problem>  ischemic-type disease  <END>  or possibly  <START:problem>  an MS plaque  <END>  or  <START:problem>  other demyelinating-type process  <END>  .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic otitis media  <END>  , bilateral , rule out  <START:problem>  middle cholesteatoma  <END>  , left ear . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic otitis media  <END>  , bilateral , with clear right middle ear but with  <START:problem>  cholesteatoma  <END>  , left middle ear . PROCEDURE PERFORMED : 1 .  <START:treatment>  Bilateral myringotomy  <END>  with insertion of  <START:treatment>  Reuter bobbin tubes  <END>  . 2 .  <START:test>  Middle ear exploration  <END>  via  <START:treatment>  myringotomy  <END>  , left ear . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General by mask . INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : This ( XX ) -year-old girl has had a history of  <START:problem>  chronic otitis media  <END>  since her early childhood . She has had a history of  <START:problem>  occasional tympanic membrane perforations  <END>  during  <START:problem>  early infancy  <END>  . Two years ago ,  <START:treatment>  myringotomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  tubes  <END>  was performed with a finding of  <START:problem>  a small mass  <END>  in the left middle ear consistent with  <START:problem>  cholesteatoma  <END>  . At the time , this was removed through the myringotomy site . Later that year ,  <START:treatment>  repeat myringotomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  tubes  <END>  was performed , and at that time ,
there was evidence of  <START:problem>  serous otitis media  <END>  but no  <START:problem>  middle ear cholesteatoma  <END>  could be visualized . Included in the previous workup was  <START:test>  a CAT scan of the temporal bones  <END>  . There was no  <START:problem>  bone erosion  <END>  noted . The patient has also undergone  <START:test>  a second opinion evaluation  <END>  approximately 1 year ago and the feeling at that time was that  <START:problem>  monitoring of the middle ear disease  <END>  was reasonable . However , since that time , the patient has had persistent evidence of  <START:problem>  middle ear effusion  <END>  , and for this reason , the patient is again scheduled to undergo  <START:treatment>  bilateral myringotomy  <END>  with a look into middle ear through  <START:treatment>  a myringotomy site  <END>  . OPERATIVE FINDINGS : The right middle ear was clear . The left middle ear contained  <START:problem>  mucoid middle ear effusion  <END>  , and through a separate myringotomy site in the anterior aspect of the tympanic membrane ,  <START:problem>  a small whitish mass  <END>  could be visualized and  <START:problem>  a small portion  <END>  of this removed with  <START:treatment>  suction  <END>  . The impression is that this is  <START:problem>  a cholesteatoma of the middle ear  <END>  .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : With the patient in the supine position and  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  administered  <START:treatment>  by mask , the head and body  <END>  were draped in sterile towels and sheets . In the right ear ,  <START:problem>  an anterior inferior myringotomy  <END>  was performed .  <START:treatment>  A tube placed into the myringotomy site  <END>  followed by several drops of  <START:treatment>  Floxin otic solution  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  cotton pledget  <END>  . On the left side ,  <START:treatment>  two myringotomies  <END>  were performed , one in the anterior quadrant and one inferiorly .  <START:treatment>  The anterior myringotomy  <END>  was dilated and the findings were as noted above .  <START:treatment>  Using suction  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  a small portion of the mass  <END>  could be aspirated and removed and sent for  <START:problem>  a specimen  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The tube  <END>  was then placed into  <START:treatment>  the inferior myringotomy  <END>  followed by several drops of  <START:treatment>  Floxin otic solution  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well . Following  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  , the patient was awakened and transferred to the recovery room in satisfactory condition . The patient is to be discharged to home with a post myringotomy instruction sheet .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic left nasal obstruction with left antrochoanal polyp  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Chronic left nasal obstruction with left antrochoanal polyp  <END>  . PROCEDURE : 1 .  <START:treatment>  Left endoscopic resection of nasal polyp  <END>  with  <START:problem>  maxillary antrostomy  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  removal of tissue  <END>  from the maxillary sinus . 2 .  <START:problem>  Left Caldwell-Luc  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  endoscopic resection  <END>  of  <START:problem>  antrochoanal polyp  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . COMPLICATIONS : None . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient has a history of  <START:problem>  chronic nasal obstruction  <END>  , primarily on the left side , with  <START:problem>  large polypoid disease  <END>  . He has undergone  <START:treatment>  previous surgery  <END>  x2 , but the problem has continued to recur . In the past ,  <START:treatment>  his surgeries  <END>  included  <START:treatment>  just transnasal polypectomy  <END>  .  <START:test>  Preoperative evaluation  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  opacification of the left maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity  <END>  consistent with  <START:problem>  an antrochoanal polyp  <END>  .
DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position .  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  was induced with  <START:treatment>  orotracheal intubation  <END>  . Cotton pledget with  <START:treatment>  Afrin  <END>  was attempted to be placed in the left nasal cavity ; although , there really was not much room because of  <START:problem>  the polypoid mass  <END>  . The patient was then draped in the usual fashion .  <START:treatment>  The pledget  <END>  was removed and the left side examined endoscopically .  <START:problem>  A large polyp  <END>  could be seen protruding into the middle turbinate .  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  1 % with 1 : 100 , 000  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was injected just anterior to the attachment of the middle turbinate . Then , using the Xomed shaver , this polyp was taken down beginning inferiorly and extending back toward the middle meatus and then the antrostomy . There was  <START:problem>  a residual polyp  <END>  extending back into the nasopharynx and this was grasped with Blakesley forceps and gradually eased from  <START:problem>  the nasopharynx into the nose  <END>  and brought out  <START:problem>  anteriorly from the nose  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Residual polypoid disease in the nose  <END>  was taken down using the shaver . Clearly , the maxillary sinus was involved and the root of  <START:problem>  this antrochoanal polyp  <END>  could not be reached from within the nose . Therefore , it was elected to do  <START:test>  a Caldwell-Luc  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  1 % with 1 : 100 , 000  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was injected in the left sublabial area , and then using  <START:treatment>  Bovie cautery  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  a sublabial incision  <END>  was made extending from the lateral incisor to the premolar .  <START:treatment>  A Joseph elevator  <END>  was used to elevate the mucoperiosteum to expose the face of the maxilla . Then , using  <START:treatment>  a hammer and chisel  <END>  , an opening was created and  <START:treatment>  the bone chip  <END>  was removed . Looking in the sinus with  <START:treatment>  a telescope  <END>  , there was  <START:problem>  polypoid disease  <END>  originating from lateral and inferior and this was addressed using the straight and then the curved Xomed shaver to completely eradicate  <START:problem>  this polypoid disease  <END>  . Looking with  <START:treatment>  an angle telescope  <END>  , there did not appear to be  <START:problem>  any residual disease  <END>  .There was clearly  <START:problem>  a large opening in to the nose  <END>  . Looking back in the nose with a 0  <START:treatment>  degree telescope  <END>  , there was  <START:problem>  polypoid disease in the ethmoid cavity  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Previous partial ethmoidectomy  <END>  had been performed and the area of the basal lamella could be seen . There was  <START:problem>  a small opening  <END>  through this that extended back to the rostrum of the sphenoid . There was  <START:problem>  polypoid disease  <END>  here anteriorly and more superiorly and this was debrided using the shaver . At this point , the maxillary sinus was  <START:treatment>  irrigated with saline  <END>  after which  <START:problem>  the sublabial incision  <END>  was closed with 4-0 chromic .  <START:treatment>  Two neuro pledgets  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  Afrin  <END>  were placed in to the left nasal cavity and the strings were brought out and secured to  <START:treatment>  the nasal dorsum  <END>  so that they could be removed prior to the patient 's discharge . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  General anethesia  <END>  was then reversed and the patient was then brought to the recovery room in stable condition .

LABORATORY AND DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES :  <START:test>  MRI of her brain done  <END>  did not reveal any enhancement in the internal auditory canal or cerebellopontine angle . 
She had  <START:problem>  small vessel ischemic disease  <END>  , which was stable .  <START:problem>  Rheumatoid factor  <END>  ,  <START:test>  Lyme screen  <END>  ,  <START:test>  ANA  <END>  and  <START:test>  ANCA  <END>  were all normal .  <START:test>  Anti-TPO antibodies  <END>  of 186 . Her last thyroid-stimulating hormone was 0 . 2 with  <START:treatment>  a free thyroxine  <END>  of 1 . 3 . IMPRESSION AND PLAN : I am pleased that the patient has not had  <START:problem>  any symptoms  <END>  for 2 months now . I suspect that she could have had  <START:problem>  labyrinthitis  <END>  or  <START:problem>  viral infection  <END>  , which resolved on its own . She is undergoing some changes in  <START:treatment>  her blood pressure medication  <END>  and will continue to check this frequently at home . She knows to call my office if she has any  <START:problem>  new neurologic symptoms  <END>  or  <START:problem>  her symptoms  <END>  of  <START:problem>  dizziness  <END>  and  <START:problem>  lightheadedness return  <END>  . I would be happy to see her in followup if the need arises . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is seen in neurologic followup for  <START:problem>  chronic Lyme disease  <END>  with  <START:problem>  CNS involvement  <END>  .

She gives a good account of  <START:problem>  recent and remote events  <END>  . Strength and ambulation are normal .  <START:problem>  IMPRESSION AND PLAN  <END>  : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old woman who I initially evaluated last month for  <START:problem>  an abnormal SPECT scan  <END>  in the setting of  <START:problem>  chronic Lyme disease  <END>  . She has had  <START:problem>  cognitive problems  <END>  since  <START:problem>  her symptoms  <END>  first began many years ago and  <START:test>  a SPECT scan of her brain  <END>  revealed  <START:test>  nonuniform distribution of radiotracer  <END>  with multiple foci of  <START:problem>  decreased activity in the bilateral frontal lobes and in the left temporal lobe  <END>  . This was felt to be consistent with her history of  <START:problem>  Lyme disease  <END>  and indicative of  <START:problem>  neuroborreliosis  <END>  . She is followed by  <START:problem>  a Lyme disease specialist  <END>  , Dr .

She is on  <START:treatment>  Biaxin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Plaquenil  <END>  and takes multiple  <START:treatment>  vitamins  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  supplements  <END>  . I referred her for  <START:test>  a followup SPECT scan of her brain  <END>  , and it revealed slight improvement of brain perfusion compared to  <START:test>  the prior SPECT scan  <END>  . The patient feels that she has reached a plateau cognitively . However , she has been under  <START:problem>  increased stress  <END>  and this may be a contributing factor . She does continue to work full time without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  . She has no  <START:problem>  new neurological complaints  <END>  . She appeared depressed today and she does admit to this and I encouraged her to follow up with her therapist . She otherwise has been neurologically stable and I will refer her for  <START:test>  a followup SPECT scan  <END>  in 6 months . I will contact her with the results , and she will follow up with me as needed .
SUBJECTIVE : This is a ( XX ) -year-old right-handed male who comes in for a second opinion of  <START:problem>  spasticity  <END>  . The patient was born 6 weeks premature and he was  <START:problem>  a twin birth  <END>  . His brother was born 4 minutes prior to him and needed  <START:treatment>  nuchal cord reduction  <END>  . As a child , he was described as  <START:problem>  a bit clumsy  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  dyslexic  <END>  and he started walking around 16 months . He was not particularly athletic ; however , he was able to go on long hikes and speed walk with his twin brother as he grew older without  <START:problem>  any deficit  <END>  . He was able to keep up with his brother just fine .  <START:problem>  His symptoms  <END>  started about 7 years ago with  <START:problem>  back spasm  <END>  . This was over the right side of his body and he claims that he was unable to walk mostly because of  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  and not  <START:problem>  weakness  <END>  . He was treated with  <START:treatment>  hydrocodone  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Flexeril  <END>  which he used for 2 weeks and apparently was normal afterwards . However , a few months later , the patient developed  <START:problem>  gradual symptoms  <END>  in  <START:treatment>  his right foot  <END>  , which he described as spastic , causing him to walk on the inside of his right foot .
He claimed that he needed to swing his whole right leg when he was walking . There was  <START:problem>  a feeling of stiffness  <END>  and  <START:problem>  cramp  <END>  . He thought that rest helped to alleviate  <START:problem>  the symptoms  <END>  . He was evaluated by Podiatry and given orthotics at that time without much relief .  <START:problem>  His symptoms  <END>  remained relatively quiescent until the spring when he developed  <START:problem>  right body aching  <END>  . He was unable to bend over in the morning and felt that  <START:problem>  his arm and shoulder  <END>  started getting  <START:problem>  weak  <END>  . He noticed that his arm became flexed at the elbow and he could extend it ; however , it was  <START:problem>  painful  <END>  . His voice and swallowing were unaffected ; however , his wife believes that he had difficulty enunciating when he was tired . He then noticed that  <START:treatment>  his fingers  <END>  started contracting and his thumb lost range of motion . The weakness that he felt in his right arm gradually progressed over this time to the point where he started using a short boot to walk , subsequently needing  <START:treatment>  a brace  <END>  , and later on he started using  <START:treatment>  a quad cane  <END>  , then started using  <START:treatment>  an electrical stimulation  <END>  device to his leg , and 3 weeks ago , he started using  <START:treatment>  an arm crutch  <END>  . He denies  <START:problem>  any overt tremor  <END>  ; however , he does have  <START:problem>  occasional jerking movements  <END>  that are involuntary of  <START:treatment>  his right arm and left leg  <END>  . His wife also noted that when he is tired ,  <START:treatment>  his right face tends  <END>  to droop to the point where he drools . Last year , he was diagnosed with  <START:problem>  Lyme disease  <END>  after  <START:problem>  bilateral Bell 's palsy  <END>  with  <START:problem>  facial weakness  <END>  .  <START:test>  A lumbar puncture  <END>  was not done at that time ; however , he was treated with  <START:treatment>  a full course of IV antibiotics  <END>  through  <START:treatment>  a PICC line  <END>  .  <START:problem>  His facial weakness  <END>  resolved after  <START:treatment>  treatment  <END>  . He has been evaluated by two neurologists and was given  <START:problem>  a provisional diagnosis of cerebral palsy  <END>  . He underwent  <START:treatment>  several MRIs  <END>  and reportedly  <START:test>  an EMG  <END>  . He has never had  <START:test>  a lumbar puncture  <END>  . He has also participated in  <START:treatment>  physical and occupational therapies  <END>  , which he believes helped  <START:treatment>  his range of motion  <END>  and he has been receiving  <START:treatment>  Botox to the hand  <END>  , which helps to relax his fingers and perform more tasks with them . OBJECTIVE :  <START:test>  Blood pressure  <END>  126 / 82 ,  <START:test>  pulse  <END>  78 , <START:test>  respirations  <END>  16 . He is a pleasant young man who is present today with his wife , twin brother and mother . Neck without  <START:problem>  bruit  <END>  . Heart has regular rhythm . No  <START:problem>  murmurs  <END>  . Lungs were clear to  <START:test>  auscultation  <END>  bilaterally . On examination of  <START:test>  extremities  <END>  , there is  <START:problem>  some trace pitting edema of the right foot and ankle  <END>  .  <START:test>  Neurological Examination  <END>  / Mental Status : The patient is alert and appropriately oriented .  <START:test>  A Montreal Cognitive Assessment  <END>  was conducted and scored 29 / 30 with 1 point missed for  <START:problem>  delayed recall  <END>  .  <START:test>  Cranial Nerve Examination  <END>  :  <START:problem>  Fundi reveal sharp disks bilaterally  <END>  . There were no  <START:treatment>  Kayser-Fleischer rings  <END>  noted . His pupils were equally round and reactive to light . His extraocular muscles were intact . There was  <START:problem>  gaze evoked horizontal nystagmus  <END>  in all directions , and there seemed to be  <START:problem>  some upbeat nystagmus in primary gaze  <END>  . He had no  <START:treatment>  difficulty following the OKN strip  <END>  and his saccades were normal . There is  <START:problem>  a left exotropia  <END>  , right hyperphoria . There was no  <START:problem>  ptosis  <END>  . There is  <START:problem>  mild facial weakness in eye closure  <END>  on the right and nasolabial fold is slightly flat on the right side . There have been no  <START:problem>  changes in hearing  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  taste  <END>  or smell . Shoulder shrug is unequal and weaker on the right side . Sternocleidomastoids are equal . Tongue is in the midline without  <START:problem>  atrophy  <END>  or  <START:problem>  fasciculation  <END>  and he is able to rapidly move his tongue . Motor And Sensory Examination : The patient has  <START:problem>  decreased eye blink rate  <END>  and appears to have  <START:problem>  some facial bradykinesia  <END>  . His voice is  <START:treatment>  a bit hypophonic  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  atrophy  <END>  . He is hypertonic with the same degree of  <START:problem>  rigidity  <END>  through  <START:treatment>  all motions of his right arm and right leg  <END>  . He was also hypertonic on the left side but to a lesser degree , and it seemed to feel more like  <START:problem>  a spastic catch  <END>  . There is also  <START:problem>  increased tone on passive head turn  <END>  with  <START:problem>  some axial rigidity  <END>  . There is no  <START:problem>  resting tremor  <END>  but he demonstrates  <START:problem>  mild tremor on the outstretched right hand  <END>  .
He has  <START:problem>  slight  <END>  4 + / 5  <START:problem>  neck flexion weakness  <END>  . Biceps are 4 / 5 on the right , triceps 4 + / 5 on the right .  <START:test>  His finger abduction  <END>  is 3 / 5 on the right and his thumb is strong . Wrist extension and flexion is full strength . Left upper extremity is normal strength . Lower extremity : He has  <START:problem>  decreased range of motion  <END>  and is unable to fully extend his knee ; although , on formal muscle strength testing ,  <START:problem>  his knee extension  <END>  appears strong . There is also a good degree of  <START:problem>  increased tone  <END>  at the right ankle , which limits his range of motion at that joint . Reflexes :  <START:problem>  Right biceps  <END>  3 , otherwise 2 + elsewhere with a good degree of  <START:problem>  withdrawal  <END>  . However , I believe that both of his toes are upgoing .  <START:problem>  Hoffman signs  <END>  are absent and  <START:problem>  jaw jerk  <END>  is not exaggerated .  <START:test>  Sensory examination  <END>  is normal to all modalities including cortical sensory ,  <START:test>  light touch  <END>  , pinprick ,  <START:test>  temperature  <END>  , vibration and he does not extinguish  <START:test>  double simultaneous stimulation  <END>  . Coordination Testing :  <START:test>  Finger-to-nose does  <END>  not reveal  <START:test>  dysmetria  <END>  and there is no  <START:test>  dysmetria  <END>  on  <START:test>  heel-to-shin  <END>  .
He is unable to perform that task on the right side . Gait Exam : He uses  <START:treatment>  an electrical stimulator right below the patella on the right leg  <END>  . When he walks ,  <START:problem>  his right leg  <END>  is kept straight and he does not flex at his hip or knee . There is no  <START:problem>  overt circumduction of the right leg  <END>  . He barely lifts  <START:treatment>  his feet off the ground  <END>  and there is somewhat of  <START:problem>  a slap of his left foot  <END>  ; although , there is no  <START:problem>  overt footdrop  <END>  . He takes at least 8 steps to turn . Neurology Consult Sample Report ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old male who presents today for  <START:problem>  a second opinion  <END>  of  <START:problem>  a subacute progressive spasticity  <END>  over the last 7 years ,  <START:problem>  increased difficulty walking  <END>  with  <START:problem>  difficulty moving right arm and hand  <END>  as well as  <START:problem>  increased rigidity  <END>  . He came to clinic today with  <START:problem>  multiple MRIs  <END>  , which included  <START:treatment>  contrast  <END>  and there did not seem to be  <START:problem>  any abnormalities  <END>  on his review . He was given  <START:problem>  a provisional diagnosis of cerebral palsy  <END>  , which does not fit with the natural course of his disease , as he was normal when he was a child .There seems to be  <START:problem>  an extrapyramidal  <END>  as well as pyramidal component on  <START:test>  his examination  <END>  today , but I do not appreciate  <START:problem>  spastic paraparesis  <END>  as he was previously evaluated to have . The time course and progression of  <START:problem>  symptoms  <END>  suggest  <START:problem>  a degenerative process  <END>  with  <START:problem>  pyramidal  <END>  and extrapyramidal component that could be part of  <START:problem>  secondary parkinsonian spectrum disease  <END>  . Perhaps , there is  <START:problem>  a hereditary component  <END>  to this . We will try to arrange a consultation with one of  <START:problem>  the movement disorder specialists  <END>  , and in anticipation of that appointment , we have asked the patient to obtain lab work today to include  <START:treatment>  ferritin  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  ceruloplasmin  <END>  ,  <START:test>  copper and liver function tests  <END>  and  <START:problem>  Wilson disease screening  <END>  . We have suggested that it maybe prudent for him to undergo  <START:test>  PET imaging of his brain  <END>  .

REFERRING PHYSICIAN : John Doe , MD REASON FOR CONSULTATION : To evaluate the patient 's current cognitive functioning using  <START:treatment>  formal neuropsychological testing  <END>  . PRESENTING DIAGNOSIS : Stroke , prior history of  <START:problem>  concussion  <END>  . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is an ( XX ) -year-old right-handed male who has a past medical history of an automobile accident approximately 3 years ago , where his vehicle was in  <START:problem>  a T-bone type accident  <END>  . The patient reported being hit to the left side . The patient also reported having  <START:problem>  a loss of consciousness  <END>  immediately following the crash and did not awaken until  <START:treatment>  EMS  <END>  personnel were taking care of him on the way to the hospital with  <START:problem>  intermittent mental status changes  <END>  . The patient was reportedly discharged on the same day and did not have  <START:problem>  any significant orthopedic injuries  <END>  or  <START:problem>  other injuries  <END>  otherwise . However , the patient did have  <START:problem>  a positive loss of consciousness  <END>  . Reportedly , the patient did not have any followup scheduled for issues related to  <START:problem>  concussion  <END>  . A few months after , the patient then underwent  <START:treatment>  knee replacement surgery  <END>  . It was noted that the patient has  <START:problem>  significant cognitive confusion  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  disorientation  <END>  and  <START:problem>  mental status change  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  all occurring  <END>  following that  <START:treatment>  surgery  <END>  . The patient 's family reported that he did not come out of  <START:treatment>  the anesthesia  <END>  very well and this persisted for  <START:problem>  a short duration  <END>  . The patient eventually recovered and had return of most mental status faculties per family report . The patient now presents secondary to  <START:problem>  stroke  <END>  resulting in  <START:problem>  right-sided weakness  <END>  and  <START:problem>  aphasia  <END>  , expressive and receptive but within the mild to moderate range . PROCEDURES : The patient completed the neuropsychological assessment battery screening module to evaluate the patient 's various cognitive functions following  <START:problem>  stroke  <END>  . RESULTS OF EXAMINATION : Overall , the patient 's current level of deficit falls in the mild to moderately impaired range . Various strengths and  <START:problem>  weaknesses  <END>  were noted as will be described below .
Within the attention and  <START:problem>  processing domain  <END>  , the patient 's performance was moderately impaired overall . Specifically , deficits in orientation to time and to self , the patient reported the wrong age . As such , when looking qualitatively at the responses , the patient had  <START:problem>  the aphasia  <END>  interfering with response performance and therefore this appeared to be the primary resultant of  <START:problem>  the orientation deficit  <END>  . The patient is not disoriented at this time . Within the immediate auditory attention modality , the patient 's performance was average . However ,  <START:problem>  more sustained auditory attention  <END>  fell within the moderately impaired range . Again , a portion of this is related to  <START:problem>  complex processing  <END>  and a portion is related to the language impairment that will be described in more detail below .
Within the information processing domain ,  <START:problem>  the patient 's performance  <END>  was moderately impaired based on just speed of  <START:problem>  performance  <END>  .  <START:test>  Error rate  <END>  had increased as the complexity of the task increased . Overall , the patient 's efficiency of processing was moderately impaired . Although the patient did use his right hand , which he is dominant for , during  <START:test>  the testing  <END>  , this only accounted for  <START:problem>  a small portion of the deficit  <END>  . The primary deficit was noted with his ability to sequence and also simultaneously task . More complex processing would result in greater severity of deficit . Within the language domain , the patient 's performance was mild to moderately impaired overall . Specifically ,  <START:problem>  auditory comprehension  <END>  fell in the severely impaired range . Immediate comprehension of tasks was average . However , as tasks required 2-3 steps and command , the patient 's performance dropped considerably .  <START:test>  The patient 's confrontation  <END>  naming fell in the average range . Although the patient was able to identify 8 / 10 items without any cueing , 2 items required phonemic cueing to increase his performance . Because of the age factor , having 2 / 10 items spontaneously incorrect was acceptable . Semantic cueing did not enhance his performance . Verbal fluency could not be formally evaluated during  <START:test>  this particular testing  <END>  as the patient became  <START:problem>  cognitively fatigued  <END>  . However , in interview and during the process of  <START:test>  the examination  <END>  , his fluency was significantly marked by  <START:problem>  anxiety  <END>  as well as marked by  <START:treatment>  reductions in processing efficiency  <END>  as well as  <START:problem>  language output deficit  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The patient 's expressive deficit  <END>  under high demand results in greater deficit performance .  <START:problem>  Within the memory domain  <END>  , the patient 's performance was only  <START:problem>  mildly impaired on the surface  <END>  . However , memory can be further broken down based on  <START:problem>  visual versus language-based memory performance  <END>  . Within the visual learning and  <START:problem>  visual memory  <END>  , the patient 's performance was below average after age correction . During delayed recognition performance , the patient 's score was above average . Qualitatively , although the patient recalled more information and detail during the delay than he did during  <START:problem>  immediate recall  <END>  , some of this may also be due to  <START:problem>  somewhat random recall  <END>  . Therefore , this needs to be interpreted with  <START:problem>  caution  <END>  but  <START:problem>  visual memories  <END>  are a relative strength in his performance and consistent with having  <START:problem>  a dominant hemisphere stroke  <END>  . Within the story-based learning immediate recall ,  <START:problem>  language-based memory  <END>  , the patient 's performance was mild to moderately impaired . On delayed recall , the patient 's performance was moderate to severely impaired . The patient had 0 %  <START:problem>  retention rate  <END>  . A portion of  <START:test>  this retention rate  <END>  appears to be at least related to the language disturbance noted above . However , further memory changes may be considered outside the normal range for his age group once the aphasia clears .  <START:problem>  Within the visual perceptual and visual spatial domain  <END>  , the patient 's performance was mild to moderately impaired . Specifically , on  <START:problem>  the visual discrimination task  <END>  , the patient 's overall accuracy fell in the mild to moderately impaired range . Qualitatively , the patient demonstrated  <START:problem>  significant intrasubtest scatter  <END>  suggesting that the patient would have performed at a higher degree prior to  <START:problem>  this particular neurologic insult  <END>  . However , this is also indicating that he may have  <START:problem>  greater impairment than what the stroke  <END>  would warrant . Differential diagnosis would be necessary for  <START:test>  further clarification  <END>  . On  <START:treatment>  a designed construction task  <END>  , the patient 's performance was  <START:problem>  mildly impaired  <END>  . However , qualitatively , the patient 's performance was actually moderately impaired when looking to see the specifics of his ability to perform the task adequately . The patient had  <START:problem>  difficulty with reversals  <END>  and was demonstrating  <START:problem>  visual spatial  <END>  as well as  <START:problem>  mild visual inattention  <END>  as noted above . The patient was not demonstrating  <START:problem>  significant visual perceptual deficits  <END>  however . Within the executive functions domain , the patient 's performance overall was considered mild to moderately impaired . Verbal fluency was already described above qualitatively . On  <START:test>  evaluation  <END>  of  <START:problem>  problem  <END>  solving , reasoning , planning , judgment , self-monitoring and  <START:problem>  self-correcting behaviors  <END>  , the patient 's performance was average . However , qualitatively , as the stimulus increased in complexity ,  <START:problem>  the patient 's problem solving skills  <END>  also increased in  <START:test>  error rate  <END>  and in difficulty requiring modest cueing to continue performance on  <START:test>  the testing  <END>  . Qualitatively ,  <START:problem>  the patient 's behavior  <END>  has been somewhat variable . At times , the patient is very good . However , at other times , primarily at night , the patient is having difficulties where he often thinks that something is happening outside of his room . The patient is also demonstrating  <START:problem>  some confusion  <END>  and also demonstrates greater impulsivity behaviorally , again in the evening time . As the patient does fatigue ,  <START:problem>  his mental processing  <END>  as well as language skills become more deficient , which may be also contributing to  <START:problem>  this behavioral change  <END>  .  <START:test>  Sensory perceptual examination  <END>  was completed . Tactile sensation was grossly intact . Audition was grossly intact with only  <START:problem>  minor deviation  <END>  secondary to aging .  <START:test>  Visual testing  <END>  was grossly intact . According to the patient 's daughter , the patient did seem to recover quite well from the concussion though he did have complications approximately 15 months ago with  <START:treatment>  undergoing surgery  <END>  and coming out of  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  , which certainly implies that there may be  <START:problem>  an underlying neurologic process  <END>  occurring . However , because of the time sequence ,  <START:problem>  his underlying process  <END>  could have been related to  <START:problem>  concussive effects  <END>  or could be related to other types of diagnosis including  <START:problem>  dementia  <END>  . IMPRESSION : At this time , neuropsychology impressions are consistent with significant language disturbance secondary to  <START:problem>  the current stroke findings  <END>  . The language disturbance is also interfering with complex processing of information and is also interfering with  <START:problem>  memory performance  <END>  , language based is more deficient than visual based memory . The patient , however , is also demonstrating  <START:problem>  other deficits  <END>  and skills that would be considered beyond the effects of  <START:problem>  this particular stroke  <END>  . The patient does have  <START:problem>  a concussion history  <END>  and this may be contributing . Differential diagnosis of  <START:problem>  dementia  <END>  would also need to be entertained but further testing would be required .  <START:problem>  Axis I  <END>  : ( 294 . 9 )  <START:problem>  Cognitive disorder  <END>  , not otherwise specified , rule out  <START:problem>  dementia syndrome  <END>  . Axis II : Deferred .  <START:problem>  Axis III  <END>  :  <START:problem>  Cerebrovascular accident  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Axis IV  <END>  : Current psychosocial stressors include needing to go to a skilled nursing facility secondary to need for  <START:treatment>  supervision  <END>  ;  <START:problem>  significant stress within the primary support system and occupational dysfunction  <END>  at this time secondary to the effects of  <START:problem>  the stroke  <END>  .  <START:test>  Axis V  <END>  : Current Global Assessment of Functioning equals 55 . Past year Global Assessment of Functioning equalled approximately 75-80 . RECOMMENDATIONS : At this time , because the testing can only demonstrate the current language impairment in addition to having  <START:problem>  cognitive impairment  <END>  that can not be fully understood with regard to etiology , the patient will need to have followup testing . This has been discussed with the patient and his family and followup is indicated in approximately 6 months for  <START:test>  repeat testing  <END>  using the same battery and then adding measures depending upon his level of recovery at that time . At that time ,  <START:problem>  a further determination  <END>  regarding  <START:problem>  dementia syndrome  <END>  can be certainly considered again based on the results of  <START:test>  the testing  <END>  . Family feedback has also been provided as part of this consultation with regards to his current cognitive performance , as well as the issues that needed to be addressed prior to discharge for purposes of discharge related to recovery and care . The patient 's family also has all my information for followup appointments as necessary . When working with the patient , it is important to allow adequate processing time secondary to the language impairment . It is also important to work with the patient in one-to-one environment as he does better with this and becomes less stressed . The higher the level of stress , the more anxious he typically will become . This was demonstrated while he was here in the hospital . Continued  <START:treatment>  supervision  <END>  would be indicated at the time of discharge secondary to  <START:problem>  cognitive impairment  <END>  . The eventual goal is for the patient to return home with his wife . Potential use of  <START:treatment>  medications  <END>  may also be indicated if the patient 's cognitive functions do not clear sufficiently over the next 3-4 weeks . Thank you , Dr . Doe , for involving me in the care of this pleasant patient .

SURGEON : John Doe ,  <START:problem>  DPM ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . HEMOSTASIS :  <START:treatment>  Electrocautery  <END>  , pneumatic ankle tourniquet set at 250 mmHg . INJECTABLES : Twenty mL of 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine plain  <END>  . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old female with clinical and  <START:problem>  radiographic signs  <END>  and  <START:problem>  symptoms  <END>  consistent with the above-stated diagnosis , which was recalcitrant to  <START:treatment>  conservative therapy  <END>  . The patient has chosen surgical correction of the diagnosis and has consented for  <START:treatment>  surgery  <END>  . All risks , benefits and  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  have been explained to the patient including but not limited to  <START:problem>  recurrence of the deformity  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  dehiscence of incision  <END>  site and the need for  <START:treatment>  further surgery  <END>  . No guarantees were made or implied to the outcome of  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room from  <START:problem>  the preoperative area  <END>  and placed on the operating table in the supine position . Following  <START:treatment>  successful intubation  <END>  and appropriate padding of all bony areas ,  <START:test>  the patient 's right lower extremity  <END>  was  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  at 60 degrees above  <START:problem>  the horizontal plane  <END>  and then  <START:treatment>  pneumatic ankle tourniquet  <END>  was placed around the well-padded right ankle . The right ankle was then scrubbed , prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .  <START:treatment>  An Esmarch bandage  <END>  was utilized to exsanguinate  <START:treatment>  the patient 's right lower extremity and the pneumatic ankle tourniquet  <END>  was inflated to 250 mmHg . Attention was directed towards the medial plantar aspect of the patient 's right heel where the medial tubercle was palpated and  <START:problem>  a 4 cm linear incision  <END>  was created just superior to the junction of the skin tension line of the plantar and medial heel .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was deepened down through the layers of  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissues  <END>  using sharp and  <START:problem>  blunt dissection  <END>  with  <START:problem>  all venous tributaries  <END>  being isolated and electrocoagulated as encountered .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  continued bluntly down to the level of the deep fascia and the fascia of the abductor hallucis muscle belly which was incised and retracted gently .  <START:problem>  Blunt dissection  <END>  continued down to the level of the medial band of the plantar fascia at its insertion into the medial tubercle of the calcaneus .  <START:treatment>  A malleable retractor  <END>  was placed on both the inferior and superior sides of  <START:test>  the plantar fascia  <END>  as it was visualized protecting overlying muscle belly and neurovascular structures .  <START:treatment>  Sistrunk scissors  <END>  was utilized to transect  <START:treatment>  the medial and central bands of the plantar fascia  <END>  with the foot being held in dorsiflexed position with the toes being dorsiflexed as well . This was done at the insertion site in the medial tubercle of the calcaneus . Upon completion , it was noted to be released visibly and palpably .
At this time ,  <START:test>  palpation  <END>  also noted presence of  <START:treatment>  a spur at the medial tubercle of the calcaneus  <END>  and attention was  <START:treatment>  directed towards the next procedure  <END>  . At this time , through  <START:problem>  the same incision  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  reciprocating rasps  <END>  were utilized to remove  <START:problem>  bone spur  <END>  , which was noted at the medial tubercle of the calcaneus . Upon completion ,  <START:test>  intraoperative C-arm fluoroscopy  <END>  was utilized to assess the removal of  <START:problem>  the bone spur  <END>  , which was noted to be removed in toto . The calcaneus retained  <START:problem>  a smooth anatomic contour  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was flushed with  <START:problem>  copious amounts of sterile saline  <END>  as it had been done preoperatively throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Closure  <END>  commenced in anatomical layers with  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissue layer being re-coapted  <END>  and maintained utilizing 4-0 Vicryl in a simple interrupted fashion . The skin was re-coapted utilizing 3-0 nylon in  <START:problem>  a horizontal mattress  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  simple interrupted suture fashion  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  A dry sterile dressing  <END>  was applied and  <START:treatment>  the pneumatic ankle tourniquet  <END>  was rapidly deflated and prompt instantaneous  <START:problem>  hyperemic response  <END>  was noted to all aspects of  <START:test>  the patient 's right lower extremity with digital capillary refill time  <END>  measuring less than 3 seconds to digits 1-5 of the right foot . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  well and was transported from the operating room to the recovery room with  <START:test>  vital signs  <END>  stable and vascular status intact to all aspects of  <START:test>  the patient 's right lower extremity  <END>  . Following a period of  <START:test>  postoperative monitoring  <END>  , the patient will be discharged home with oral and written instructions per Dr . Doe and is to call Dr . Doe with  <START:problem>  any complications  <END>  . The patient was given a prescription of  <START:treatment>  Percocet  <END>  5 / 325 and  <START:treatment>  Motrin  <END>  600 mg for the patient 's  <START:problem>  postoperative discomfort  <END>  .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Monteggia fracture dislocation of the right elbow  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Monteggia fracture dislocation of the right elbow  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Open reduction  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  internal fixation Monteggia fracture  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  right elbow-forearm  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Less than 50 mL . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : Under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  , with the patient in the supine position on the operating table ,  <START:treatment>  a pneumatic tourniquet  <END>  was applied to the right upper arm . The right elbow was prepped and draped in the routine manner all the way from the tourniquet up to fingertips . On inspection , the arm was unstable . There was  <START:problem>  swelling  <END>  about  <START:treatment>  the elbow forearm  <END>  .  <START:test>  X-rays  <END>  reviewed again indicated there was  <START:problem>  a fracture of the proximal ulna  <END>  and there was a large butterfly fragment anteriorly involving the coronoid process with significant displacement without any contact with the bone that was fractured . The radial head was dislocated as well .
There was  <START:problem>  a posterior dislocation of the radial head  <END>  . This combination is known as  <START:problem>  Monteggia fracture dislocation  <END>  . Esmarch was used and then the tourniquet inflated up to 250 , then the Esmarch was removed .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was made along the ulnar border of the proximal ulna and then curved around the tip of the olecranon .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was taken down through the skin ,  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissue  <END>  , fascia down to  <START:treatment>  the bone muscle strip  <END>  . It moved down as much as needed , but  <START:problem>  the periosteum  <END>  was left intact as much as possible .  <START:problem>  The fracture  <END>  identified in both proximal and distal ,  <START:problem>  butterfly fragment  <END>  , which was large consisting of the articular surface anteriorly on the elbow joint and the coronoid process with extended fragment distally . First , we brought the 2 main fragments together and then plated it . We used  <START:treatment>  a reconstruction plate  <END>  , 7-hole , and  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  was stabilized first with  <START:treatment>  clamp  <END>  and plate and then screws inserted after  <START:treatment>  drilling  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  screw length measurement  <END>  . This was checked on image intensifier off and on . 
The butterfly fragment was brought into reduction position ahead of time and held with  <START:treatment>  clamp  <END>  . Finally ,  <START:treatment>  interfragmentary fixation  <END>  was done . Three such screws were inserted , some of them transversely and  <START:problem>  others slightly oblique thereby  <END>  transfixing the butterfly fragment to the bone . These were lag screws to get the lagging action .  <START:treatment>  Fixation  <END>  was found to be excellent on  <START:test>  C-arm view  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Multiple pictures  <END>  were obtained . The radial head relocated previously after  <START:treatment>  joint irrigation  <END>  . We checked  <START:problem>  the radial head through this incision  <END>  by rotating the forearm , and there was  <START:problem>  a small piece of the radial head  <END>  , it was knocked off but it was still attached to the soft tissue and in proper position . This was reduced in proper position as well , and therefore , we did not have to make any  <START:problem>  separate incision  <END>  to address the radiohumeral joint .  <START:treatment>  A thorough irrigation  <END>  was done of the joint through  <START:problem>  this incision  <END>  prior to fixation of  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  . After  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  was fixed ,  <START:treatment>  a thorough irrigation  <END>  was done and  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  closed . The muscles were reattached . The fascia with initially subcutaneous tissue ,  <START:problem>  fatty and dorsal tissue  <END>  approximated with interrupted 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A 3-0 Vicryl suture  <END>  was used for  <START:problem>  the subcutaneous tissue  <END>  . The skin was closed with  <START:treatment>  skin clips  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  dressing applied  <END>  . The elbow was placed in  <START:treatment>  a long arm holder cast  <END>  which was well molded . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA :  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  . TOURNIQUET TIME : 75 minutes .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : Minimal . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a pleasant ( XX ) -year-old female who fell at home and had  <START:problem>  a severe injury to her right elbow  <END>  . The patient was then seen in the emergency room before being referred here .  <START:test>  Upon evaluation  <END>  , the patient did have  <START:problem>  a fracture of the olecranon  <END>  and of the radial head . The patient was informed of the severity of  <START:problem>  her injury  <END>  and that she required  <START:problem>  internal fixation of her fractures  <END>  . The patient understands there is a strong potentiality she would have loss of range of motion of her arm ,  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  and  <START:problem>  stiffness  <END>  , but she would still require  <START:treatment>  surgery  <END>  to optimize
The patient was provided  <START:treatment>  prophylactic antibiotics  <END>  , taken back to the operating suite and placed on the table .  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  was administered and the patient tolerated this well . The right arm was then positioned , prepped and draped in the usual fashion . Prior to making  <START:problem>  an incision  <END>  , the consent was reviewed for the last time . The olecranon was initially dressed . The posterior approach was made to the olecranon .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was based more medial than usual to accommodate for  <START:problem>  the second incision  <END>  , which can be used for  <START:test>  the radial head  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Careful dissection  <END>  down to soft tissue was performed .  <START:problem>  The fracture  <END>  was located . It was washed out of  <START:problem>  any bony debris  <END>  or  <START:treatment>  soft tissue  <END>  and was reduced .  <START:problem>  Fracture  <END>  was reduced using  <START:treatment>  towel clips  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Two K-wires  <END>  were drilled through the olecranon process distally . Remainder of  <START:treatment>  the reduction  <END>  was visualized under  <START:test>  fluoroscopy  <END>  . Next , a 3 . 2 drill bit was requested and drilled across the ulna distal to  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A 16 gauge wire  <END>  was brought through the hole and in  <START:problem>  a figure-of-eight cerclage-type fashion  <END>  was tensioned down to allow for maintenance of  <START:treatment>  reduction of the fracture  <END>  . Its positioning was once again confirmed .  <START:treatment>  Essential anatomic fixation  <END>  was noted . Following this , the wires were clipped and  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  was closed in layered fashion . Next , attention was drawn to  <START:problem>  the radial head fracture  <END>  . Standard Kocher approach to the radial surface was made .  <START:problem>  Careful dissection  <END>  down to soft tissue was performed . The interval between the acromion and  <START:problem>  extensor carpi ulnaris  <END>  was established . The radiocapitellar joint was exposed . The hand was maintained and  <START:problem>  pronation  <END>  to help protect the posterior nerve and the radial nerve .  <START:problem>  The fracture fragment  <END>  was located and found to be comminuted and was unable to fix . At this point , it was determined that  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  needs to be excised .
 <START:treatment>  A saw  <END>  was requested and remaining aspect of  <START:test>  the radial head  <END>  was excised . Next , the size of the radial head was determined to be 22 mm and broaching was then initiated up to a size 3 . The size 3 stump and 22 mm head were impacted on the back table and then placed within the radial shaft . The elbow was put in range of motion , found to have stability . No  <START:problem>  instability  <END>  was noted and no  <START:problem>  subluxation  <END>  was noted .

POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Bilateral mandibular fracture  <END>  , right parasymphyseal and left angle regions . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Open reduction  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  internal fixation of bilateral mandibular fracture  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  right parasymphyseal area  <END>  and left angle regions . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA :  <START:treatment>  General anesthesia  <END>  . FLUIDS : About 2 liters of  <START:treatment>  crystalloids  <END>  .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : About 100 mL . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought into the operating suite and given  <START:treatment>  general nasotracheal anesthesia  <END>  . Oral care was given . The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner and 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was infiltrated into the areas where  <START:problem>  incisions  <END>  were made , which included  <START:problem>  the right lower buccal sulcus area and the neck region  <END>  on the left side . The patient was then prepped and draped in the usual sterile manner .
We went ahead and put in  <START:treatment>  the MMF  <END>  screws first . Two applied to each jaw , just at the level of premolars . We then went ahead and  <START:problem>  exposed the fractures  <END>  .  <START:problem>  An intraoral incision  <END>  was made first .  <START:problem>  A small incision  <END>  was made in the mucosa . This was done using electrocautery .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was carried through the mucosa , muscle down to the periosteum .  <START:treatment>  The superior periosteal elevator  <END>  was then used to expose  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The fracture  <END>  was seen . We went ahead and placed some fixation . The OsteoMed system was used for this . On the proximal side of  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  , we placed  <START:treatment>  a 6-hole plate  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Three 8 mm screws  <END>  were placed on the proximal side of  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  . Superiorly , we placed a 1 . 5 plate .  <START:treatment>  Three 5 mm screws  <END>  were placed on the proximal side of  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  . We then went ahead and opened  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  at the left angle area . Again ,  <START:problem>  an external Risdon-type incision  <END>  was made a couple of centimeters below the inferior border of the mandible .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was carried through the skin down to the platysma . Platysma was then divided .
Then ,  <START:problem>  careful dissection  <END>  was begun to avoid injury to the facial nerve . The facial nerve that is the marginal mandibular branch was identified quite nicely . The patient had  <START:problem>  a reaction  <END>  going on in this area in regards to the soft tissue . It was very fibrotic and scarred . Due to this , we felt that  <START:problem>  this fracture  <END>  is  <START:problem>  a bit older  <END>  . Again , we dissected carefully , not to injure the marginal mandibular branch . We dissected down to  <START:treatment>  the pterygomasseteric sling  <END>  . This was divided , gaining access to the mandible .  <START:problem>  The periosteum  <END>  was incised and  <START:treatment>  subperiosteal elevator  <END>  used to dissect in the subperiosteal plane to expose  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  . Again , we ran into the area of preabscess ,  <START:treatment>  necrotic tissue  <END>  . This area was cleaned out , debrided out and irrigated with  <START:treatment>  copious amounts of normal saline  <END>  . We placed  <START:treatment>  a 6-hole plate  <END>  in the inferior border of  <START:problem>  this fracture  <END>  on the proximal side ,  <START:treatment>  three 8 mm screws  <END>  were placed . The patient was then placed into intermaxillary fixation with  <START:treatment>  rubber bands  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  the MMF screws  <END>  .
We then went ahead to place  <START:treatment>  the distal screws  <END>  . Again , 3 screws were placed on  <START:problem>  the inferior plate of the right parasymphyseal fracture  <END>  ;  <START:treatment>  these were 8 mm screws  <END>  . This was a 2 . 0 plate .  <START:treatment>  Two 5 mm screws  <END>  were placed into the 1 . 5 plate . We then placed  <START:treatment>  the 3 distal screws at the angle fracture  <END>  . These were 8 mm screws . We then irrigated both incisions with  <START:treatment>  copious amounts of normal saline  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The intraoral incision  <END>  was closed in 2 layers approximating the muscle with 3-0 Vicryl and the mucosa with 3-0 chromic .  <START:problem>  The extraoral incision  <END>  closed after irrigating again in a multilayer fashion . The platysmata approximated with 4-0 Monocryl . The subcutaneous interdermal layer with 5-0 Monocryl and the skin with 5-0 fast-absorbing gut followed by  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  . The patient was awoken , extubated and taken to the recovery room in satisfactory condition , having tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well .

 <START:problem>  Small bleeding points  <END>  were controlled with  <START:treatment>  bipolar cautery  <END>  . The interval between the flexor carpi ulnaris and  <START:problem>  extensor carpi ulnaris  <END>  was developed . The ulna was exposed periosteally .  <START:problem>  Fracture  <END>  shows  <START:problem>  some slight comminution  <END>  . Using a curette and  <START:treatment>  rongeur  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  hematoma  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  debris  <END>  were removed from  <START:problem>  the fracture site  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Bone clamps  <END>  were applied to  <START:problem>  the proximal distal fragments  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  was reduced . This was aided with  <START:treatment>  sterile finger traps  <END>  and 10 pounds of  <START:treatment>  traction  <END>  . A 7-hole DCP plate was then applied to the ulna with  <START:problem>  1 hole overlying the fracture  <END>  , 3 holes proximal and 3 holes distal . The plate was then secured to the proximal fragment first . This was done with 3 .  <START:treatment>  5 mm cortical screws  <END>  . Holes were made followed by measuring , followed by placement of appropriate size self-tapping screw .  <START:problem>  Bicortical purchase  <END>  was obtained on  <START:treatment>  all screws  <END>  . Following  <START:treatment>  placement of the proximal screws  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  the distal screws  <END>  were placed . This was aided with  <START:treatment>  bone clamps  <END>  applied to  <START:treatment>  the plate  <END>  and distal fragment with  <START:problem>  fracture alignment  <END>  confirmed .
 <START:treatment>  Screw holes  <END>  were placed in the neutral compression position . Again , standard technique was utilized by drilling and measuring by placement of  <START:treatment>  a properly sized screw  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  An interfragmentary screw  <END>  was then placed at  <START:problem>  the fracture site  <END>  . This was done by overdrilling the near cortex . The 3 . 5 mm screws were used throughout with  <START:treatment>  bicortical purchase  <END>  obtained on  <START:treatment>  all screws  <END>  except for  <START:treatment>  the interfragmentary screw  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Fracture alignment  <END>  was confirmed by  <START:test>  direct inspection  <END>  and by  <START:test>  fluoroscopy  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  All screw lengths  <END>  were adequate . The muscle and fascial layer were closed with  <START:problem>  interrupted  <END>  5-0 Vicryl . The remainder of  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  was left open .

Donor gallbladder for  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  . 2 . Native liver for  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  . DONOR INFORMATION : The donor was a ( XX ) -year-old who had received a  <START:treatment>  cardiac transplant  <END>  recently and had  <START:problem>  anoxic injury to the brain  <END>  and was felt to be unrecoverable by the attending physicians . The family graciously donated the patient 's liver for  <START:treatment>  harvest  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  retransplantation  <END>  . After going over the donor 's history , medical , surgical and social , verifying that  <START:test>  all viral studies  <END>  were negative for  <START:problem>  hepatitis C  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  hepatitis B  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  HIV  <END>  and HTLV and having negative  <START:test>  blood cultures  <END>  , the donor organ was accepted as a DCD for this patient . The patient and family arrived and I discussed the options , risks , benefit ,  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  of both surgical and  <START:treatment>  nonsurgical intervention  <END>  for  <START:problem>  end-stage liver disease  <END>  . I discussed the age of the donor liver and that there was  <START:problem>  a small ischemic injury  <END>  but felt that it was a very good liver for the patient . Questions were entertained and discussed . All were answered to their satisfaction . The patient signed informed consent and was taken to the operating room . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : In the donor room , the liver was placed on the back table under sterile conditions . The liver was prepped in standard fashion , mobilizing the suprahepatic and infrahepatic vena cava , ligating and excising the adrenal vein and the adrenal gland itself .
The hepatic artery from the celiac origin , aortic patch , all the way up to the takeoff of the right and left arteries was mobilized . Small branches were suture ligated with 5-0 Prolene . The splenic and  <START:problem>  GDA takeoffs  <END>  were left open . The hepatic artery was flushed again with iced HTK as well as the portal vein . There were no  <START:problem>  other defects  <END>  within the artery . The artery had no  <START:problem>  injuries  <END>  . The portal vein was mobilized , splitting the peritoneum all the way to the hilum of the liver . This too was flushed . No defects were noted and the effluent of the HTK was without  <START:problem>  blood  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The bile duct  <END>  was examined . It was probed up into the right and  <START:problem>  left bile ducts  <END>  and found to be without  <START:problem>  obstruction  <END>  . The bile was irrigated from the bile duct with iced  <START:treatment>  heparin and saline  <END>  . The gallbladder was now removed in  <START:problem>  a top-down fashion to the cystic duct and cystic artery  <END>  , both were ligated with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk ligatures  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the gallbladder  <END>  was sent to Pathology for  <START:test>  evaluation  <END>  .
The remaining neurovascular and  <START:problem>  lymphatic tissues of the hilum of the liver  <END>  , that were not part of structures already mentioned , were mobilized and ligated so as not to impinge on other structures and excised . With the liver in good shape , without  <START:problem>  injury  <END>  and flushed well , the liver was repackaged by  <START:problem>  UNOS guidelines  <END>  and placed back into the cooler . In the recipient room , the patient was taken into the operating room and placed supine on the operating table . After adequate IV access and  <START:treatment>  IV sedation  <END>  , the patient was  <START:treatment>  intubated  <END>  and anesthetized .  <START:treatment>  Central venous access and arterial cannulization  <END>  as well as  <START:treatment>  a Swan-Ganz catheter  <END>  had been placed previously by Anesthesiology .  <START:treatment>  A Foley catheter  <END>  was placed by the nursing staff aseptically .  <START:test>  The patient 's left leg  <END>  was bumped out , exposing the groin , and  <START:treatment>  the patient 's left arm  <END>  was placed on  <START:test>  an armboard straight  <END>  out , exposing the left axilla .  <START:problem>  The left axilla , abdomen , pelvis , left leg  <END>  and groin were all prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine solution  <END>  , draped with sterile linen and  <START:treatment>  sterile drapes  <END>  . The abdomen was examined and no  <START:problem>  hernias  <END>  were noted . There was quite  <START:problem>  a bit of ascites  <END>  , however , within it . With the patient timeout being done , the ABO cross-checked with the paperwork that came with  <START:problem>  the organ from the OPO  <END>  and the paperwork was signed and  <START:treatment>  the operation begun  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A bisubcostal incision  <END>  was created with  <START:treatment>  a # 10 blade scalpel  <END>  with  <START:problem>  midline extension  <END>  . The underlying tissues were taken down with electrocautery to the peritoneum . Large subcutaneous branches of veins were ligated with 3-0 and  <START:treatment>  4-0 silk ligatures  <END>  and divided between  <START:treatment>  the ligatures  <END>  . On opening the peritoneum ,  <START:problem>  copious amounts of clear yellow ascites  <END>  was encountered and  <START:problem>  aspirated from the abdomen  <END>  . Approximately 7 liters were aspirated from the abdomen and pelvis . The peritoneum was opened to the extent of  <START:problem>  the skin incision  <END>  as well as muscular wall . The midline extension was now opened .  <START:problem>  The fatty tissue  <END>  with  <START:problem>  varices  <END>  were removed up to the xiphoid . Extremely large 1 .  <START:problem>  5 cm varices  <END>  within the falciform ligament were divided into segments , clamped with  <START:treatment>  Kelly clamps  <END>  and divided between  <START:treatment>  the clamps  <END>  . Each was ligated with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk ligatures  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . With the abdomen now completely opened ,  <START:problem>  the Thompson retracting system  <END>  was set up for  <START:problem>  visualization  <END>  and  <START:problem>  retraction  <END>  . The membranous portion of the falciform ligament was taken down in the hepatic veins with  <START:treatment>  the electrocautery  <END>  . The patient was  <START:problem>  quite coagulopathic  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Anesthesia  <END>  maintained almost constant administration of  <START:treatment>  platelets  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  FFP  <END>  . Large varices were all ligated and divided between the ligatures as the case proceeded .  <START:problem>  The left lobe of the liver  <END>  was mobilized taking down the triangular ligament .  <START:test>  The argon beam coagulator  <END>  was used for  <START:problem>  nonvariceal  <END>  oozing and for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . The right lobe of the liver was now mobilized taking down the triangular ligament to the hepatic veins . The right peritoneal covering of the vena cava was taken down with  <START:problem>  sharp and blunt dissection  <END>  . The adrenal vein into the vena cava was identified , circumferentially dissected , ligated and divided between  <START:treatment>  the ligatures  <END>  . The vena cava of the right side was fully mobilized from  <START:problem>  the retroperitoneum and several large varices  <END>  were ligated and divided . Attention was now brought to the left side of the vena cava . The peritoneal covering was taken down and divided down to the retroperitoneum .  <START:problem>  Varices  <END>  were identified and  <START:treatment>  suture  <END>  ligated and divided . The gastrohepatic ligament had previously been divided . No replaced vessels were noted within it . The suprahepatic vena cava was now circumferentially dissected and  <START:treatment>  an umbilical tape  <END>  was placed for control . The infrahepatic vena cava was mobilized , circumferentially dissected and  <START:treatment>  an umbilical tape  <END>  was placed for control .  <START:problem>  The porta hepatitis  <END>  was now entertained .  <START:treatment>  Peritoneal covering  <END>  was removed off of  <START:test>  the porta hepatis  <END>  .
The hepatic arteries to the left and right lobes were identified , circumferentially dissected , ligated high up into the hilum of the liver and divided .  <START:problem>  The bile duct  <END>  was identified . The gallbladder was quite  <START:problem>  tense  <END>  and  <START:problem>  enlarged  <END>  . The ampulla went down all the way to the duodenum and was quite stuck . This complex was circumferentially dissected and was assured not to have a replaced right artery within the posterior aspect of it , was ligated high up into the hilum and divided dividing part of the gallbladder with the common duct . This whole complex was now mobilized off the portal vein and the portal vein was stripped of investing tissues down to the head of the pancreas for  <START:test>  eventual clamping  <END>  . The gallbladder was now mobilized off of  <START:problem>  the common duct  <END>  and the duodenum with blunt and  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  , removing it completely , being left with the common duct . The common duct was ligated with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk ligatures  <END>  . The liver was now ready for  <START:treatment>  complete hepatectomy  <END>  . The donor liver was now brought out by the fellow on the back table and irrigated with 2 liters of  <START:treatment>  albumin solution  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The hepatectomy  <END>  was now completed ,  <START:problem>  leaving generous suprahepatic  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  infrahepatic vena caval cuffs  <END>  . The liver was sent to Pathology for  <START:test>  evaluation  <END>  . The retroperitoneum was argon beam coagulated . Individual figure-of-eight 2-0  <START:treatment>  silk suture ligatures  <END>  were placed as needed . The suprahepatic and  <START:treatment>  infrahepatic vena caval cuffs  <END>  were now prepared , making one clean cloaca at both . The portal vein was cut back to appropriate length . The hepatic arteries were now dissected down to the takeoff of the right and the left . The dissection down to the GDA was performed , but the GDA was not fully mobilized . The common hepatic was quite adequate in size for  <START:treatment>  anastomosis  <END>  as  <START:treatment>  a branch patch  <END>  . The artery was now placed under  <START:treatment>  a lap pad  <END>  and protected with  <START:treatment>  a malleable retractor  <END>  . With  <START:treatment>  hemostasis adequate  <END>  , the donor liver was now  <START:problem>  flushed with albumin  <END>  ; it was brought up to the surgical field .  <START:treatment>  The suprahepatic vena caval cuffs  <END>  were anastomosed in  <START:problem>  an end-to-end fashion  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  an everting cuff technique  <END>  with 3-0 simple running  <START:treatment>  Prolene sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The infrahepatic vena caval anastomosis  <END>  was performed in a similar fashion with  <START:treatment>  everting cuff technique  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  4-0 Prolene suture  <END>  left untied for  <START:problem>  blood flush  <END>  later on . The portal vein was anastomosed to the donor portal vein with everting cuff technique with  <START:problem>  a 4-0 plain double-armed simple running suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The portal vein anastomosis  <END>  was tied down with a growth factor of one-third of its diameter to allow for expansion of the portal vein . With the patient stable and  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  ready , the portal vein was opened to flow . The liver was bathed in  <START:treatment>  hot saline  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a blood flush out the infrahepatic vena caval anastomosis  <END>  was performed , approximately 650 mL was expressed until the blood was warm to touch and ready for reinstitution back to the heart .
 <START:treatment>  The sutures of the infrahepatic vena cava  <END>  were drawn tight . The Klintmalm clamp of the suprahepatic vena cava was now released ,  <START:problem>  re-establishing flow  <END>  from the portal system through the liver and back to the heart . The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  . The infrahepatic vena cava was tied down to make  <START:treatment>  this hemostatic and complete the anastomosis  <END>  . The portal vein growth factor was pulled up slightly and a figure-of-eight of 5-0 Prolene was placed to secure this in place and make  <START:treatment>  this anastomosis hemostatic  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Infrahepatic vena caval tributary  <END>  from the recipient was noted and was sutured with a figure-of-eight of 5-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The infrahepatic vena caval Blalock-Taussig clamp  <END>  was removed , re-establishing flow from the legs back to the heart . The suprahepatic vena cava was inspected and found to have  <START:problem>  a back wall anastomotic leak  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Figure-of-eights  <END>  of 4-0 and 3-0 Prolene were placed and  <START:treatment>  this anastomosis  <END>  was rendered  <START:treatment>  hemostatic  <END>  . The gallbladder fossa was argon beam coagulated for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:problem>  FloSeal  <END>  was placed within the gallbladder fossa and Nu-Knit was placed over with  <START:problem>  a fresh 4 x 8 to maintain hemostasis  <END>  . The native artery was now uncovered , bathed in  <START:treatment>  papaverine  <END>  . The donor artery on  <START:test>  the aortic cuff  <END>  was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  heparinized saline  <END>  and had  <START:problem>  generous backbleeding  <END>  . The donor artery was cut at the splenic takeoff and  <START:treatment>  a splenic patch  <END>  was created .  <START:treatment>  A small Satinsky clamp  <END>  was placed at the base of the recipient artery incorporating surrounding tissues to occlude it . The right and  <START:problem>  left ties of the hepatic arteries  <END>  were cut away and  <START:treatment>  a branch patch  <END>  was made and cut to size . The two arteries were now anastomosed in  <START:treatment>  an end-to-end fashion  <END>  with 6-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene suture  <END>  in a Carrel fashion .  <START:treatment>  The Satinsky clamp  <END>  was removed . Air and  <START:problem>  debris  <END>  were flushed out of  <START:problem>  the splenic takeoff  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the GDA  <END>  and  <START:problem>  splenic takeoff  <END>  were then clamped ,  <START:problem>  re-establishing arterial flow to the liver  <END>  .  <START:test>  The total anastomosis time  <END>  for  <START:test>  all venous structures  <END>  was 30 minutes .
 <START:problem>  The cold ischemia  <END>  time from cross-clamp to opening of the portal vein to flow was 7 hours . The liver had good turgor , was quite pink and had no  <START:problem>  areas of ischemia  <END>  within it .  <START:problem>  All dissection planes  <END>  were now investigated again for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:test>  The argon beam coagulator  <END>  and  <START:problem>  FloSeal  <END>  as well as  <START:treatment>  individual sutures  <END>  were used for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . There were no  <START:problem>  surgical vessels  <END>  or  <START:problem>  anastomotic leaks  <END>  .  <START:problem>  All oozing blood  <END>  was of  <START:problem>  a medical nature  <END>  at this time .  <START:treatment>  The biliary anastomosis  <END>  was now entertained . The donor common bile duct was cut back to a fresh edge and the vascular bundles at the 9 and 3 o'clock positions were oversewn with a figure-of-eight of 5-0  <START:problem>  Maxon at the cut edge  <END>  . The donor common bile duct was uncovered . The tie was cut away . The bile duct was somewhat larger than the donor bile duct .  <START:problem>  The cystic duct  <END>  was separate , was oversewn , bringing the two bile ducts closer to equal size . The recipient bile duct was cut at the crush demarcation of the tie and the vascular varices ligated with 5-0  <START:treatment>  Maxon suture  <END> . The two common bile ducts were now anastomosed in  <START:problem>  an end-to-end fashion  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 5-0 Maxon sutures  <END>  . The donor liver was making bile throughout this period of time as a good indicator of function . The abdomen was now irrigated with  <START:problem>  copious amounts of sterile saline  <END>  and aspirated dry . The patient had several areas of  <START:problem>  oozing blood  <END>  , including the muscular wall incisions . However , there was no  <START:problem>  surgical bleeding  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  JP drain  <END>  was placed in an infraportal position and brought out through  <START:problem>  a separate stab incision  <END>  .  <START:test>  All sponge , needle  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  instrument counts  <END>  were verified to be correct x3 .

She did have  <START:problem>  some preterm labor  <END>  and was on  <START:treatment>  Brethine  <END>  , which did arrest the  <START:problem>  contractions  <END>  . She was having  <START:problem>  some contractions  <END>  on her own . She noticed  <START:problem>  decreased fetal movement  <END>  recently . She had  <START:problem>  a contraction stress test  <END>  that was equivocal , and due to the fact that she was 3 cm with  <START:problem>  an equivocal contraction stress test  <END>  and history of  <START:problem>  decreased fetal movement  <END>  and also  <START:problem>  decreased variability  <END>  , she was admitted for  <START:treatment>  induction  <END>  of  <START:problem>  labor  <END>  . She received  <START:treatment>  Pitocin  <END>  . She did have some episodes during  <START:treatment>  the Pitocin induction  <END>  where she did have  <START:problem>  some decelerations  <END>  ; they were not chronic or deep and they responded well when  <START:treatment>  the Pitocin  <END>  was turned off . After  <START:treatment>  the Pitocin  <END>  would be running , after a while , she would begin to see other episodes of  <START:treatment>  decelerations  <END>  , and finally after enough episodes and  <START:problem>  enough persistent decelerations  <END>  combined with failure to  <START:problem>  descend  <END>  and  <START:problem>  failure to progress  <END>  , she never got past 8 cm and -2 , she was taken for  <START:treatment>  cesarean section  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  her epidural anesthetic  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After the epidural was fortified , in the supine position ,  <START:problem>  a small incision  <END>  was made in the suprapubic region and was extended to open subcutaneous with  <START:treatment>  the Bovie  <END>  and extended in both directions . We coagulated the bleeders that were encountered . The muscle was separated in the usual fashion . Peritoneum was opened with  <START:problem>  pickups  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  and extended laterally in both directions .
 <START:treatment>  The bladder blade  <END>  was placed .  <START:problem>  The bladder reflection  <END>  was developed .  <START:problem>  Uterine incision  <END>  was made and then we noticed there was  <START:problem>  a very large vein  <END>  running across the lower uterus .  <START:problem>  The uterine incision  <END>  was made and then opened with  <START:treatment>  the hemostat  <END>  . It was then extended digitally . What fluid was left was clear . Baby was delivered through  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  and found to have  <START:problem>  some caput  <END>  and also the baby had the cord loosely around the neck and loosely around the left leg . The baby was delivered , cried immediately and the cord was clamped and cut after the baby was suctioned . The baby was shown briefly to the parents and then the baby was handed off to the neonatologist in attendance . The cord blood was taken . The placenta was manually removed . The uterus was explored .  <START:treatment>  Ring forceps  <END>  were placed on the corners of the uterus and  <START:problem>  an Allis  <END>  was placed at one end .  <START:treatment>  The bladder blade  <END>  was reinserted . Uterus was closed in 2 layers with  <START:treatment>  a 1 chromic suture  <END>  , the first layer being interlocking .  <START:treatment>  Some interrupted 1 chromic sutures  <END>  were placed .
After the uterus was closed and good hemostasis was obtained , we copiously irrigated the pelvis . After doing the irrigation , we went ahead and checked  <START:problem>  the bladder  <END>  , which was left to spontaneously heal . We then closed the muscle with a running 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  . The fascia was closed with 0 Maxon from one end to the midline and from the other end to the midline . Subcutaneous was irrigated . A subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl was used to close the skin as well as  <START:problem>  Steri-Strips  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A pressure dressing  <END>  was applied . Clots were expelled from the uterus . Mother was doing well . The patient was then sent to the recovery room in satisfactory condition .

LABORATORY DATA : Initial labs included  <START:test>  a CBC  <END>  , which was within normal limits .  <START:problem>  Electrolyte panel  <END>  showed  <START:problem>  sodium  <END>  of 133 ,  <START:problem>  potassium  <END>  of 4 . 1 ,  <START:problem>  chloride  <END>  100 ,  <START:problem>  bicarb  <END>  27 ,  <START:problem>  BUN  <END>  13 ,  <START:test>  creatinine  <END>  1 . 1 and  <START:problem>  a random glucose  <END>  of 291 with  <START:test>  calcium  <END>  of 9 .  <START:test>  LFTs  <END>  were within normal limits .  <START:test>  Total cholesterol  <END>  was 145 ,  <START:test>  HDL  <END>  44 ,  <START:test>  LDL  <END>  92 ,  <START:test>  triglycerides  <END>  49 .  <START:test>  TSH  <END>  within normal limits . HOSPITAL COURSE : 1 . The patient was evaluated and treated by the multidisciplinary treatment team including physicians , nurses ,  <START:problem>  social workers  <END>  and therapists .  <START:treatment>  All medications  <END>  were presented to the patient and he gave written consent to all  <START:treatment>  the medications  <END>  he was given , as well as was explained the risks , benefits ,  <START:problem>  side effects  <END>  and alternatives of  <START:treatment>  all medication therapies  <END>  . The patient was integrated in some milieu on the ward and encouraged to attend to  <START:problem>  his ADLs  <END>  and participate in groups . 2 . Schizophrenia : On admission , the patient 's Risperdal was gradually titrated up to a goal dose of 3 mg twice a day prior to discharge . He tolerated  <START:treatment>  the medication  <END>  well with no  <START:problem>  significant side effects  <END>  and reported that  <START:problem>  his hallucinations  <END>  significantly improved . He denied  <START:problem>  psych symptoms  <END>  prior to discharge . The patient presented as very organized in his thoughts , linear , logical and appropriate . He did not have  <START:treatment>  any behavioral or management problems  <END>  while in the unit and participated in groups very well with good interactions with staff and peers , as there has been some question whether the patient also has a mood component of  <START:problem>  his psychiatric disease  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  His trazodone  <END>  was increased to 200 mg at bedtime to help with sleep and  <START:treatment>  his Wellbutrin  <END>  was maintained at his home dose . His mood improved throughout hospitalization as well , and he was  <START:treatment>  euthymic  <END>  with appropriate affect prior to discharge . The patient did have  <START:test>  neuro psych testing  <END>  done while in the hospital . Results are pending at the time of discharge .
3 . Diabetes : The patient was diagnosed with new onset of  <START:problem>  diabetes  <END>  during  <START:treatment>  this hospitalization  <END>  .  <START:test>  A hemoglobin A1c  <END>  was sent , which came back  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  at 8 . 7 . He also had  <START:problem>  a fasting glucose done  <END>  , which was  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  at 216 . Given that the patient met criteria for  <START:problem>  diabetes  <END>  , endocrine was consulted and agreed with the plan to start patient on a low dose of  <START:treatment>  metformin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  titrate  <END>  it up to a goal of 500 mg twice a day prior to discharge . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the metformin  <END>  well and  <START:problem>  his blood sugars  <END>  came under good control .  <START:test>  His blood glucoses  <END>  prior to discharge were 98 and 106 respectively . He was maintained on  <START:treatment>  a sliding scale insulin  <END>  as needed for  <START:problem>  increased blood sugars  <END>  ; however ,  <START:treatment>  the glucose  <END>  seemed to be well controlled with just the oral hypoglycemic agent .  <START:problem>  The patient 's headaches  <END>  also seemed to resolve once he was well hydrated and  <START:test>  his blood sugars  <END>  were under control . He will follow up with the endocrine clinic in 2 to 3 weeks for  <START:treatment>  management  <END>  of  <START:problem>  his diabetes  <END>  and outpatient referral form was faxed and the patient was instructed to follow up with an appointment . 4 .  <START:problem>  Shoulder pain  <END>  : The patient has had  <START:problem>  left shoulder pain  <END>  , which appears to be a frozen shoulder versus  <START:problem>  a rotator cuff tendinitis  <END>  . We continued him on  <START:treatment>  Naprosyn  <END>  as needed for  <START:problem>  shoulder pain  <END>  . We also consulted  <START:treatment>  physical therapy  <END>  , who were able to provide him with  <START:treatment>  several exercises  <END>  to improve his range of motion and  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  in his shoulder . The patient was very agreeable with  <START:treatment>  completing the exercises  <END>  and claims to continue doing them as an outpatient . 5 .  <START:treatment>  Nasal cyst  <END>  : An incidental finding on  <START:test>  MRI  <END>  was  <START:problem>  Tornwaldt cysts  <END>  . ENT was consulted and recommended that he follow up as an outpatient as these are usually benign and most likely just an incidental finding and do not have  <START:treatment>  any pathological significance  <END>  . He should follow up if he has any further questions or concerns .
DISCHARGE CONDITION : Good . DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS : 1 . Diet :  <START:treatment>  ADA diabetic diet  <END>  . 2 . Activity : Ad lib with  <START:treatment>  continuing of the exercises  <END>  for  <START:problem>  his left shoulder  <END>  . 3 .  <START:treatment>  Take medications  <END>  as prescribed and not making any changes without first consulting with his outpatient doctor . 4 . He was advised to avoid substances as he has been sober now for greater than 3 months . 5 . He should follow up with endocrine clinic .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Pancreatic carcinoma  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Pancreatic carcinoma  <END>  .  <START:test>  PROCEDURES  <END>  PERFORMED : 1 .  <START:treatment>  Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  partial excision of superior mesenteric vein and primary repair  <END>  . 2 .  <START:test>  Diagnostic laparoscopy  <END>  . 3 . Placement of  <START:treatment>  pancreatic stent  <END>  , feeding  <START:treatment>  jejunostomy tube  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  gastrostomy tube  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD OPERATIVE FINDINGS : The patient had  <START:problem>  a mass in the head of the pancreas  <END>  , predominantly in the uncinate process , but extending upward to envelop the distal bile duct . There was no obvious evidence of  <START:problem>  studding  <END>  . The arterial supply was anomalous . The splenic artery came off the aorta as  <START:problem>  a single vessel  <END>  .  <START:problem>  All of the hepatic arterial blood supply  <END>  came off  <START:problem>  the celiac trunk  <END>  in the usual location that a replaced right hepatic artery comes off .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was brought to the operating room and anesthetized and prepped and draped widely . The patient had been administered  <START:treatment>  intravenous antibiotics  <END>  within 60 minutes of  <START:problem>  incision  <END>  as per SCIP protocol . The patient was administered  <START:treatment>  subcutaneous heparin  <END>  and had  <START:treatment>  placement of venous compression boots  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  venous thromboembolism prophylaxis  <END>  . We began by performing  <START:test>  an initial diagnostic laparoscopy  <END>  , creating  <START:problem>  a small vertical supraumbilical incision  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a cautery  <END>  and placing the trocar under direct vision . After establishing  <START:problem>  a pneumoperitoneum  <END>  , we could visualize the upper abdomen noting the liver to be  <START:problem>  slightly cholestatic  <END>  but no evidence of  <START:problem>  portal hypertension  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  ascites  <END>  or  <START:problem>  peritoneal studding  <END>  . We therefore evacuated  <START:treatment>  the pneumoperitoneum  <END>  and removed the laparoscopy equipment .  <START:test>  The diagnostic laparoscopy site  <END>  was extended upward to the xiphoid to allow entry into the abdominal cavity . The round ligament was excised and the falciform ligament divided before placement of  <START:treatment>  the Bookwalter retractor  <END>  . The duodenum was manually kocherized , feeling  <START:problem>  the mass  <END>  in the expected location and it was freely separable from the inferior vena cava . After fully kocherizing the duodenum , we entered into the lesser sac by taking down the vessels along the greater curvature of the stomach from the mid portion of the stomach to a level just beyond the pylorus . We then mobilized along the inferior edge of the pancreas using cautery , identifying the superior mesenteric vein and  <START:problem>  several venous branches  <END>  , draining the stomach as well as the head of the pancreas . These were ligated and divided and we created  <START:test>  a tunnel between the pancreatic neck  <END>  and the portal vein . There was no sign of any involvement of the portal vein or this initial portion of the superior mesenteric vein . As we mobilized out along the superior mesenteric vein on its right side , however , we came to an area where there appeared to be a 1 cm segment of the superior mesenteric vein that was tethered to the curvature of the head of the pancreas and the uncinate process . This had the appearance , however , that we could easily control this and excise the portion of the vein along with the specimen itself . Before attending to this , we moved up to the region of the hepatic hilum mobilizing all of  <START:treatment>  the lymph node tissue  <END>  from the region of the normal location for the common hepatic artery , noting at this point that there was no evidence of  <START:treatment>  any common hepatic artery  <END>  and then all of  <START:problem>  the blood supply  <END>  came off the superior mesenteric artery to the right side of the portal vein . This actually facilitated  <START:treatment>  lymph node mobilization along the left hilar region  <END>  and along the superior edge of the superior mesenteric artery . We exposed  <START:treatment>  the anterior surface of the hepatic arteries  <END>  , noting both left and right branches came off  <START:problem>  this aberrant vessel of the superior mesenteric artery  <END>  . The gallbladder was mobilized from the liver bed from above downward using the cautery ,

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Central nasal pterygium  <END>  , right eye . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Central nasal pterygium  <END>  , right eye . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Radical pterygium excision  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  conjunctival graft  <END>  , right eye . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ASSISTANT : None . ANESTHESIA : Local monitored  <START:treatment>  anesthesia care  <END>  . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION :  <START:problem>  Symptomatic central nasal pterygium  <END>  , right eye . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : Adequate  <START:treatment>  local anesthesia  <END>  was established in the right eye using lid  <START:problem>  block  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  retrobulbar injection  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  2 % equally mixed with  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  0 . 75 % .  <START:test>  A 25 gauge Atkinson needle  <END>  was used for  <START:problem>  the retrobulbar block  <END>  . The right eye was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion .  <START:treatment>  A lid speculum  <END>  was inserted to expose the globe . Then , 6-0 black  <START:treatment>  silk stay sutures  <END>  were taken through the  <START:problem>  superficial peripheral cornea  <END>  at 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock .  <START:problem>  A radial incision  <END>  was made down through bulbar conjunctiva to bare sclera above and below the body of  <START:problem>  the pterygium  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The pterygium  <END>  was  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  up from pe
 <START:problem>  The pterygium  <END>  was  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  up from perilimbal sclera .  <START:problem>  The head of the pterygium  <END>  was removed from the cornea by blunt scraping with 5700 Beaver blade and  <START:treatment>  stripping  <END>  with 0 . 12 toothed  <START:treatment>  forceps  <END>  .  <START:test>  The medial rectus  <END>  was placed on  <START:problem>  muscle hook  <END>  and  <START:problem>  all pterygium tissues  <END>  were meticulously dissected away from the medial rectus . The base of  <START:problem>  the pterygium  <END>  was severed with  <START:treatment>  Westcott scissors  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Adequate hemostasis  <END>  was established throughout the procedure as necessary with  <START:treatment>  bipolar cautery  <END>  . Additional portions of  <START:problem>  the pterygium  <END>  were morselized .  <START:problem>  Residual pterygium tissues  <END>  were removed from the cornea and perilimbal sclera by blunt scraping with 5700 Beaver blade and stripping with  <START:treatment>  tying forceps  <END>  . The resulting  <START:problem>  pterygium defect  <END>  measured 6 mm at the limbus and extended 12 mm posterior to the limbus .  <START:problem>  A shallow incision  <END>  was made through superior bulbar conjunctiva with  <START:treatment>  Vannas scissors  <END>  in dimensions to match  <START:problem>  the pterygium defect  <END>  . The donor conjunctiva was spread over the pterygium defect so as to be appropriately aligned limbus to limbus . The limbal and  <START:treatment>  radial aspects of the graft  <END>  were sutured to the episclera and  <START:treatment>  recipient conjunctivae  <END>  was appropriate with interrupted circumferentially oriented 10-0  <START:treatment>  nylon sutures  <END>  with the knots buried . The posterior aspect of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  was sutured directly to episclera or  <START:problem>  superficial medial rectus  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 7-0 Vicryl sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Subconjunctival gentamicin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Decadron  <END>  were injected .  <START:treatment>  The stay sutures  <END>  were removed and the eye was dressed with  <START:treatment>  patch and shield  <END>  . The patient was transferred to postanesthesia care , having tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Right ring finger trigger digit  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Right ring finger trigger digit  <END>  .  <START:test>  PROCEDURES  <END>  PERFORMED : 1 .  <START:treatment>  Right ring finger A1 pulley release  <END>  . 2 . Right ring  <START:problem>  finger digital block  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA :  <START:problem>  Digital block  <END>  . COMPLICATIONS : None . SPECIMENS : None . INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is an ( XX ) -year-old right-hand dominant male who presented with  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  in the right fourth digit that started shortly after undergoing  <START:treatment>  bilateral carpal tunnel release  <END>  . He had good resolution of  <START:problem>  his symptoms  <END>  after  <START:treatment>  his carpal tunnel release  <END>  ; however ,  <START:problem>  pain  <END>  in the ring finger was limiting recovery . Clinically , this was consistent with a trigger finger with  <START:problem>  tenderness  <END>  to  <START:problem>  palpation over the A1 pulley  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a palpable nodule  <END>  and  <START:problem>  mild locking  <END>  . After failing a course of  <START:treatment>  conservative treatment  <END>  , the patient decided to proceed with  <START:treatment>  surgical intervention consisting of right ring finger A1 pulley release  <END>  . OPERATIVE FINDINGS :  <START:problem>  Severe thickening of the A1 pulley  <END>  was appreciated overlying the flexor sheath . The underlying flexor tendons had  <START:problem>  mild degenerative changes  <END>  within them . Full range of motion of the digit without locking or  <START:problem>  catching  <END>  was achieved after adequate A1 release . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After obtaining informed consent , identifying the correct patient and correct  <START:problem>  operative site  <END>  , the patient had placement of a right ring  <START:treatment>  finger digital block  <END>  anesthetic using 1 %  <START:treatment>  lidocaine mixed  <END>  with 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  in a 50 / 50 mixture . He was then taken to the operating suite and the right hand and upper extremity were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . He received  <START:treatment>  preoperative IV antibiotics  <END>  and the hand was exsanguinated with  <START:treatment>  an Esmarch bandage  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  a well-padded forearm tourniquet  <END>  inflated to appropriate  <START:treatment>  arm pressure  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A transverse incision  <END>  was created in the MP flexion crease overlying the fourth ray .  <START:problem>  Dissection  <END>  was carried down through the skin and  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissues  <END>  and a combination of blunt and  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  was utilized to identify  <START:problem>  the flexor sheath  <END>  .  <START:test>  The digital nerves  <END>  were retracted to either side of the sheath and the A1 pulley was exposed . It was completely incised from its most proximal extent distally into the most proximal aspect of the A2 pulley .  <START:test>  The palmar pulley  <END>  was also released .  <START:test>  The flexor tendons  <END>  were retracted from  <START:problem>  the wound  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a Ragnell retractor  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Mild degenerative changes  <END>  were appreciated .  <START:problem>  A small amount of synovitis  <END>  was sharply excised . The patient was asked to flex and extend the digit and there was no  <START:problem>  locking  <END>  or  <START:problem>  catching  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  bed was then irrigated with  <START:treatment>  normal saline  <END>  and the skin edges reapproximated with 4-0  <START:treatment>  Prolene suture  <END>  followed by application of  <START:treatment>  a light sterile dressing  <END>  .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Right knee failed anterior cruciate ligament graft reconstruction  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:treatment>  Right knee failed anterior cruciate ligament graft reconstruction  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Revision anterior cruciate ligament graft reconstruction  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  arthroscopic assisted  <END>  , with  <START:treatment>  patella tendon allograft  <END>  and with  <START:treatment>  platelet-rich plasma augmentation  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General with  <START:problem>  femoral nerve block  <END>  . INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient has had  <START:problem>  multiple recurrent anterior cruciate ligament graft reconstruction failures  <END>  . She has had 5  <START:test>  total reconstructions  <END>  with  <START:problem>  persistent failure  <END>  . The patient presents now for  <START:treatment>  revision reconstruction  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  patella tendon allograft  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  platelet-rich plasma augmentation  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After  <START:treatment>  successful general anesthesia  <END>  and  <START:problem>  femoral nerve block  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  the patient 's right knee  <END>  was examined .  <START:problem>  Lachman  <END>  3 + and  <START:problem>  pivot shift  <END>  3 + .  <START:treatment>  The patient 's knees  <END>  were then prepped and draped sterilely . Standard arthroscopic portal sites were established and  <START:test>  a routine examination  <END>  was performed . Prior to this , the tourniquet was raised to 300 mmHg .  <START:treatment>  The patellofemoral joint  <END>  showed evidence of  <START:problem>  mild grade 2 chondromalacia  <END>  . The medial and lateral gutters were free of loose bodies . The medial compartment was inspected . There was  <START:problem>  mild grade 2 chondromalacia  <END>  with evidence of  <START:treatment>  a previous partial medial meniscectomy  <END>  . The intercondylar notch was inspected .  <START:treatment>  The anterior cruciate ligament graft  <END>  was absent . There was no  <START:treatment>  residual graft tissue present  <END>  . There was evidence of  <START:treatment>  a previously placed bone tunnel  <END>  and screw .  <START:treatment>  The bone tunnel  <END>  and screw were in the 10 o'clock position and were in the process of absorbing . The posterior cruciate ligament was intact . The lateral compartment was inspected . There was no  <START:problem>  chondromalacia  <END>  noted and the lateral meniscus was stable to probing .
 <START:treatment>  An arthroplasty  <END>  was performed , removing what appeared to be  <START:problem>  an impinging lesion  <END>  at the 10 o'clock position on the entrance to the intercondylar notch . Care was taken to preserve bone posteriorly .  <START:problem>  The over-the-top position  <END>  was visualized .  <START:treatment>  The graft  <END>  was then created on the back table . The Cascade platelet-rich plasma system was used to suture 2 globules of  <START:problem>  platelet-rich plasma growth factor  <END>  . One globule was inserted at the proximal portion of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  , the other segment was inserted at the distal portion of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  , one each side of the intraarticular portion of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  . The first globule measured approximately 21 mm in length and the second globule measured 31 mm in length . These were sutured in place using 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl interrupted sutures  <END>  . The tibial tunnel was then drilled , the pin entered the joint at the posterior border of the lateral meniscus at the level of the joint line . With the knee in full extension , there was no evidence of  <START:problem>  impingement  <END>  . Patella was reamed to a width of 9 mm . 
 <START:problem>  An 8 mm over-the-top guide  <END>  was then used . The knee was flexed to 120 degrees and the pin was moved to the lateral thigh . The femoral tunnel was reamed to a width of 9 mm and a depth of 20 mm . This new tunnel was adjacent to the old tunnel . The debris from the old tunnel was removed . This was actually in perfect position for  <START:treatment>  the interference  <END>  screw , which could be placed at the 10 o'clock position on  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The bone tunnel  <END>  was placed at the 9 o'clock position on  <START:test>  the medial wall of the lateral femoral condyle  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A 9 x 20 mm screw  <END>  initially used with this did not provide adequate fixation ; this was removed .  <START:treatment>  A 10 x 25 screw  <END>  was placed anterior to the graft and this provided fixation ; however , because this was  <START:treatment>  the sixth revision  <END>  , it was felt that  <START:treatment>  a button  <END>  should be placed on  <START:treatment>  the lateral femoral cortex  <END>  to provide  <START:treatment>  augmentation  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A 4 cm incision  <END>  was made over  <START:test>  the iliotibial band  <END>  .The sutures that had been passed through the lateral thigh were then recaptured and the exit point on  <START:problem>  the lateral femoral condyle  <END>  was found . A 2-hole button was then placed against  <START:test>  the lateral femoral condyle and the sutures  <END>  were tied over the button . This provided  <START:treatment>  augmentation fixation  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The graft  <END>  was checked for  <START:problem>  tibial pistoning  <END>  through a range of 0-90 degrees . No pistoning occurred indicating correct  <START:treatment>  isometric placement of the graft  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The graft  <END>  was also checked for  <START:problem>  impingement  <END>  with the knee in full extension . There was no evidence of  <START:problem>  impingement  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The tibial portion of the graft  <END>  was fixed with  <START:test>  a 10 x 25 mm Linvatec Matrix screw  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The screw  <END>  was placed in 0 degrees of flexion .  <START:test>  A 4-hole button  <END>  was used for  <START:treatment>  augmentation  <END>  on this side of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The augmentation  <END>  was felt to be necessary as the patient has had  <START:problem>  multiple recurrent failures of reconstructions  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  The tourniquet  <END>  was released .  <START:problem>  Wounds  <END>  were copiously irrigated using  <START:treatment>  normal saline antibiotic solution  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Bleeding  <END>  was controlled using electrocautery . The skin and subcutaneous tissues were closed using 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl interrupted sutures  <END>  . The iliotibial band was closed using 0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl interrupted sutures  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A sterile dressing  <END>  was placed . The patient was placed into  <START:treatment>  a knee immobilizer splint  <END>  . She was awake and stable at the completion of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  .

Because of  <START:problem>  the elevated creatine phosphokinase  <END>  and  <START:problem>  lupus anticoagulant  <END>  , we asked the patient to have  <START:test>  cardiac evaluation  <END>  . The outcome of  <START:test>  evaluation  <END>  was negative . The patient is now taking a mini aspirin a day for  <START:treatment>  the lupus anticoagulant  <END>  . For  <START:treatment>  treatment  <END>  , the patient was taking  <START:treatment>  Enbrel  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  Plaquenil  <END>  at low dose and  <START:treatment>  prednisone  <END>  . We asked her to stop the Enbrel and increase the Plaquenil to 200 mg b . i . d . , the therapeutic dose . Since then , the patient denies  <START:problem>  any increased symptoms  <END>  . She was not getting better either . She continues to take  <START:treatment>  prednisone  <END>  5 mg daily . In the past , she had  <START:treatment>  difficulty tapering off the prednisone  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Her recent brain  <END>  and  <START:problem>  cervical spine MRIs  <END>  showed  <START:problem>  nonspecific signal  <END>  but there was no  <START:problem>  enhancement  <END>  .  <START:test>  Her cervical spine MRI  <END>  did not show  <START:problem>  significant disk disease  <END>  or  <START:problem>  neural impingement  <END>  .

There is small possibility of  <START:problem>  autoimmune myopathy  <END>  , but we think the patient should gradually taper the prednisone since we have increased the Plaquenil to a full dose . We asked her to taper  <START:treatment>  the prednisone  <END>  1 mg every 4 weeks until the dose is 2 mg . At that time , the patient can taper down every 6 weeks . There is also a possibility of  <START:problem>  autoimmune neuromuscular disease  <END>  such as multiple sclerosis ; although ,  <START:test>  her recent brain MRI  <END>  did not show enhancement . We will monitor  <START:problem>  development of new symptoms  <END>  . Lupus is less likely given the absence of  <START:test>  specific antibodies  <END>  , normal complements and  <START:problem>  other lupus-specific symptoms  <END>  . Nonetheless , we will monitor and the patient will stay on  <START:treatment>  Plaquenil  <END>  . For  <START:test>  the antiphospholipid antibody  <END>  , the patient will stay on  <START:treatment>  the mini aspirin  <END>  . We will see the patient for  <START:treatment>  followup  <END>  in 4 months , earlier if she develops any  <START:problem>  new symptoms  <END>  or has difficulty with the taper .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 150 mL . COMPLICATIONS : None . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was taken to the operating room and administered  <START:treatment>  a general anesthetic  <END>  . The patient was then placed in  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  and sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner .  <START:treatment>  A Foley catheter  <END>  was placed in the bladder .  <START:test>  A weighted speculum  <END>  was placed in the vaginal vault .  <START:treatment>  A single-tooth tenaculum  <END>  was placed in  <START:problem>  the anterior lip of the cervix  <END>  , and the cervical os was dilated to # 8  <START:treatment>  Hegar dilator  <END>  .  <START:test>  A RUMI uterine manipulator  <END>  was then attached to the uterus with  <START:treatment>  the cervical ring  <END>  .  <START:test>  The weighted speculum  <END>  was removed from the vaginal vault .  <START:treatment>  The single-tooth tenaculum  <END>  was removed from the anterior lip of the cervix .  <START:treatment>  Two sutures  <END>  were placed on the lateral aspect of the cervix to be used as traction later in the case .  <START:problem>  A horizontal supraumbilical incision  <END>  was made with  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Veress needle  <END>  was placed in  <START:test>  the abdominal cavity  <END>  . Through  <START:treatment>  the Veress needle  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  carbon dioxide  <END>  was infused until  <START:problem>  pseudo pneumoperitoneum  <END>  was obtained .  <START:test>  The Veress needle  <END>  was then removed and  <START:problem>  the supraumbilical incision  <END>  was extended .  <START:treatment>  A 12 mm trocar  <END>  and sleeve was then placed in abdominal cavity without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The trocar  <END>  was removed and  <START:treatment>  the robotic laparoscope  <END>  was placed in  <START:test>  the abdominal cavity  <END>  .  <START:test>  The pelvic viscera  <END>  were examined . The uterus was found to be diffusely enlarged with  <START:problem>  uterine leiomyoma  <END>  .
The left ovary was diffusely enlarged with  <START:problem>  a dermoid cyst  <END>  . The right ovary appeared to be normal . There were  <START:problem>  adhesions in the posterior cul-de-sac  <END>  . There were  <START:treatment>  multiple implants  <END>  of  <START:problem>  endometriosis  <END>  noted .  <START:treatment>  Local anesthesia  <END>  was then instilled at the sites of all the ports prior to placing the Surgiports .  <START:problem>  Two 8 mm Surgiports  <END>  were then placed just inferior to the umbilicus and lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle bilaterally . These ports were put into the abdominal cavity under direct visualization .  <START:treatment>  The assistant 's port  <END>  was then placed just beneath the ribs in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen . The da Vinci robot was then backed with the Surgiports . In the left arm was placed  <START:problem>  a plasma kinetic device  <END>  and the right with the hot scissors . Due to the fact that there was  <START:problem>  a large left dermoid cyst on the left ovary  <END>  , it was felt that the left ovary should be removed . The left infundibulopelvic ligament was then isolated , cauterized in 3 contiguous areas with the PK . The infundibulopelvic ligament was then cut . The left adnexa was then separated from pelvic side wall using PK and  <START:test>  the hot scissors  <END>  . The round ligament on the left was then cauterized and cut . The left side of the vesicouterine peritoneum was then incised ,  <START:problem>  forming the left side of the bladder flap  <END>  . The left uterine vasculature was then isolated and  <START:treatment>  cauterized  <END>  . The right ovary appeared to be within normal limits , so it was felt it would be okay to leave it . The right ovary was densely adherent to the posterior surface of uterus .  <START:problem>  These adhesions  <END>  were carefully lysed using the hot scissors . The uteroovarian ligament was cauterized with the PK and then cut . The proximal fallopian tube was similarly cauterized with  <START:problem>  PK  <END>  and cut with  <START:treatment>  scissors  <END>  . The round ligament was cauterized in 3 contiguous areas and cut with the PK . The vesicouterine peritoneum on the right was then incised in  <START:problem>  elliptical fashion forming the right side of bladder flap  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The bladder  <END>  was pushed down off the lower uterine segment without difficulty . Uterine vasculature on the right was then cauterized . The ring was identified anteriorly and  <START:treatment>  an anterior colpotomy  <END>  was performed . The uterine vasculature was cauterized bilaterally as the colpotomy was extended . After  <START:problem>  completely circumscribing the scissors from the vaginal cuff  <END>  , the uterus and left adnexa were then delivered through the vagina .  <START:treatment>  The vaginal cuff  <END>  was closed with  <START:treatment>  running V-Loc suture  <END>  . Pelvis was lavaged with copious amount of  <START:treatment>  normal saline  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  was found to be secure . The 12 mm supraumbilical Surgiport was removed and  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  was closed in layers using an Endoclose . Fascia was closed with 2-0 Vicryl . All the Surgiports were then removed under direct visualization .  <START:problem>  Indigo carmine  <END>  was given intravenously .  <START:test>  A cystoscopy  <END>  was performed .  <START:problem>  Both ureteral orifices  <END>  were identified . There was noted to be  <START:problem>  blue dye extravasating  <END>  from both ureteral orifices .  <START:treatment>  Foley  <END>  was placed back into the bladder .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was closed with  <START:treatment>  interrupted 3-0 plain suture  <END>  .  <START:test>  All sponge , needle  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  instrument counts  <END>  were found to be correct .  <START:treatment>  The urine in the Foley bag  <END>  was noted to be clear blue . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well and was sent to the recovery room in excellent condition .

I will admit the patient to the floor for  <START:test>  further evaluation  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  status post chest tube placement  <END>  . PROCEDURE NOTE : The patient gave informed consent for  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  after discussion of the risks and benefits of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  . The left chest was prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  and was sterilely draped . Approximately 4 mL of 2 %  <START:treatment>  lidocaine  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was placed in  <START:problem>  the lateral chest wall  <END>  at approximately the 6th intercostal space , in the mid axillary line .  <START:treatment>  A # 11 blade  <END>  was used to make  <START:problem>  a 2 cm incision  <END>  and a Kelly clamp was used to dissect bluntly down through the tissues and then across the top of the 5th rib into the 4th interspace whereupon spreading the clamp a rush of air was noted . I inserted my finger into that place . I did not feel the diaphragm at all .  <START:treatment>  A # 20-French thoracostomy tube  <END>  was placed posteriorly and superiorly using open technique . The patient was then hooked to suction . The patient began to feel better right after that , and  <START:treatment>  the tube  <END>  was secured with  <START:treatment>  2-0 silk simple interrupted sutures  <END>  on each side of  <START:treatment>  the chest tube  <END>  , which then wrapped around  <START:treatment>  the chest tube  <END>  to secure it .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient was seen in joint consultation with the departments of  <START:problem>  speech pathology  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  radiology  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  a modified barium swallow  <END>  . The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old male with a history of  <START:treatment>  stage IV left base of the tongue squamous cell carcinoma  <END>  . He underwent  <START:treatment>  chemoradiation treatment  <END>  in the past and had  <START:treatment>  PEG tube  <END>  placed during  <START:treatment>  his treatment  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  primary nutritional support  <END>  . The patient has been followed by this department for  <START:treatment>  dysphagia therapy  <END>  and  <START:test>  objective swallowing examinations  <END>  . The patient has been seen through the department of gastroenterology for  <START:test>  serial dilations  <END>  due to  <START:treatment>  upper esophageal narrowing  <END>  secondary to  <START:treatment>  prior radiation therapy  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  His PEG tube  <END>  was subsequently pulled and most  <START:problem>  recent modified barium swallow  <END>  performed revealed  <START:problem>  mild oropharyngeal dysphagia  <END>  characterized by  <START:problem>  reduced pharyngeal bolus propulsion  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  moderately decreased hyolaryngeal elevation  <END>  and good airway protection , without  <START:problem>  laryngeal penetration  <END>  or  <START:problem>  aspiration  <END>  . There was pooling in the vallecula after more dense consistencies . This cleared successfully with use of  <START:problem>  left head turn  <END>  , chin  <START:treatment>  tuck  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a subsequent liquid wash  <END>  . The patient had excellent passage through the cricopharyngeus at that time .  <START:treatment>  Today 's evaluation  <END>  was scheduled 6 months after the last MBS to monitor the patient 's progress over time . He reports that his last dilation was approximately 3 months ago . Since that time , he has not noted major changes in  <START:problem>  his swallow  <END>  . He still has  <START:problem>  difficulty with solids  <END>  . He is unsure if  <START:problem>  the left head turn makes  <END>  any significant difference at this time . He is crushing most of  <START:treatment>  his medications  <END>  and taking them with food . He is otherwise unable to swallow them successfully with a sip of  <START:treatment>  a drink  <END>  . He is maintaining his weight and has been doing so for the past 6 months . He has no recent history of  <START:problem>  pneumonia  <END>  . He is managing on  <START:treatment>  a soft solid diet  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  thin liquids  <END>  at this time .  <START:test>  SWALLOWING EVALUATION  <END>  : The patient was imaged standing in the lateral and anterior to posterior projection . The patient was administered  <START:problem>  graduated size boluses of thin liquid barium  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  nectar thick barium  <END>  and semisolid . Particulate solid was deferred as well as  <START:test>  a 13 mm barium tablet  <END>  secondary to  <START:problem>  visualized deficits  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Oral phase  <END>  revealed good bolus acceptance and containment with timely trigger for  <START:treatment>  all liquids  <END>  . There is labored anterior to posterior transit with delayed trigger of  <START:problem>  pharyngeal swallow  <END>  and tongue pumping prior to trigger of  <START:problem>  pharyngeal swallow  <END>  with semisolids . This appears secondary to  <START:problem>  the patient 's xerostomia  <END>  , making it difficult for him to form a soft and moist bolus prior to trigger of  <START:problem>  pharyngeal swallow  <END>  . The patient was noted to have  <START:problem>  weak pharyngeal bolus propulsion  <END>  and  <START:problem>  moderately reduced hyolaryngeal elevation  <END>  . The patient does not get  <START:treatment>  full epiglottic deflection  <END>  during  <START:treatment>  the swallow  <END>  , thus allowing for deep laryngeal penetration with  <START:problem>  thin  <END>  and  <START:problem>  nectar thick barium into the endolarynx  <END>  , to which he does not throat clear in response . Cued throat clear successfully clears the airway . There is  <START:problem>  constriction  <END>  through the upper esophagus with  <START:problem>  weak pharyngeal contractility  <END>  . Subsequently , there is retention in the vallecula and piriform sinuses with  <START:problem>  all consistencies  <END>  . The patient is able to swallow 2 to 3 times to achieve clearance for  <START:treatment>  liquids  <END>  .  <START:problem>  More dense consistencies such  <END>  as particulate solids pool heavily in the vallecula .  <START:problem>  Multiple left head turn  <END>  , chin  <START:treatment>  tuck swallows  <END>  and  <START:problem>  a sip of thin liquid  <END>  subsequently helps to clear the vallecula . In the anterior to posterior projection , the barium was symmetric . On the Rosenbek Penetration /  <START:problem>  Aspiration Scale  <END>  , severity level rating of 3 with liquids indicating that  <START:problem>  contrast  <END>  remained above  <START:problem>  the vocal folds  <END>  with visible residue remaining , and fair level rating of 1 for semisolids indicating that contrast did not enter the airway . Images were obtained in synapse for  <START:problem>  review of proximal esophageal narrowing  <END>  . SUMMARY AND IMPRESSION : Moderate  <START:problem>  oropharyngeal dysphagia  <END>  characterized by  <START:problem>  reduced pharyngeal bolus propulsion  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  moderately decreased hyolaryngeal elevation  <END>  and narrowing through the pharynx and upper esophagus .  <START:problem>  Weak pharyngeal bolus propulsion  <END>  and  <START:problem>  incomplete epiglottic deflection  <END>  results in pooling in the vallecula with all consistencies . Use of  <START:treatment>  left head turn , chin tuck  <END>  and  <START:problem>  subsequent liquid wash  <END>  appears to be the best strategy at this time for clearing residue . The patient has laryngeal penetration with  <START:treatment>  all liquids  <END>  , subsequent from spillover from the vallecula into the endolarynx . He does not consistently throat clear in response , although cued throat clear helps to clear any penetrated materials . At this time , the patient was counseled to use intermittent throat clear and  <START:treatment>  re-swallow  <END>  during meals and after  <START:treatment>  liquids and to utilize left head turn , chin tuck  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  subsequent liquid wash  <END>  with soft solids . Food should be very soft and moist and near ground / chopped consistencies . This is similar to what the patient is currently eating .  <START:treatment>  Medications  <END>  should continue to be crushed . Given that he has not had  <START:problem>  a dilation  <END>  in approximately 3 months , we will refer back to Gastroenterology for question of further dilation to assist with achievement of  <START:test>  pharyngeal clearance  <END>  . The patient can be seen back for  <START:test>  repeat testing  <END>  as indicated after  <START:problem>  repeat dilation  <END>  and should ultimately continue to be monitored via  <START:test>  periodic objective swallowing study  <END>  . The patient is continuing with  <START:treatment>  his dysphagia therapy exercises  <END>  as is recommended and this will help to maintain swallowing function and hopefully continue to strengthen it as well . The patient can follow up with  <START:problem>  speech pathology  <END>  after  <START:treatment>  any further dilation  <END>  . RECOMMENDATIONS : Soft moist consistencies , near ground /  <START:treatment>  chopped consistencies  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  thin liquids  <END>  ;  <START:treatment>  medications  <END>  crushed in puree ;  <START:problem>  intermittent throat clear re-swallow  <END>  after liquids ;  <START:problem>  use of left head turn  <END>  , chin  <START:treatment>  tuck  <END>  followed by  <START:treatment>  liquid wash  <END>  for solid foods ; upright 90 degrees with all p . o . ;  <START:problem>  decrease bolus size  <END>  and  <START:test>  rate  <END>  of presentation ;  <START:problem>  alternate bites  <END>  and sips ; follow up with Gastroenterology for question of repeat dilation ;  <START:test>  further objective testing  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  support  <END>  from  <START:problem>  speech pathology  <END>  after followup with Gastroenterology ; to contact with any further questions .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : Epidural and general . SPECIMENS REMOVED : Uterus and cervix with  <START:treatment>  bilateral tubes  <END>  and ovaries .  <START:problem>  Thick adhesions of the large and small bowel  <END>  were noted to the posterior fundal surface of the uterus .  <START:problem>  ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS  <END>  : 350 mL . COMPLICATIONS : None . CONDITION OF PATIENT : Stable post  <START:treatment>  surgery  <END>  .
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : After informed consent was obtained , the patient was taken to the operating room . The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual manner for  <START:treatment>  major abdominal surgery  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  An indwelling Foley catheter  <END>  was inserted .  <START:treatment>  The patient 's ileostomy site  <END>  was covered with  <START:treatment>  a lap sponge  <END>  and then  <START:problem>  a Vi-Drape  <END>  placed across the prepped abdomen to ensure its integrity intraoperatively from the surgical field .
Given the patient 's  <START:problem>  previous midline incision  <END>  , it was decided to attempt to proceed with  <START:problem>  a Pfannenstiel incision  <END>  hoping to avoid the ileostomy site with its possible  <START:problem>  adhesions  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The procedure  <END>  was started by creating  <START:problem>  a Pfannenstiel incision  <END>  1 to 2 fingerbreadths above the pubic symphysis using  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a scalpel  <END>  . The scalpel was then used to  <START:problem>  dissect sharply downward toward the anterior rectus fascia  <END>  which was nicked with  <START:treatment>  the scalpel  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The Mayo scissors  <END>  was used to extend the fascial incision bilaterally in a curvilinear fashion . The underlying rectus muscle was identified and separated by both blunt and  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  Metzenbaum scissors  <END>  . The parietal peritoneum was identified , grasped with pickups with teeth x2 , nicked with  <START:test>  a scalpel and then the pelvis  <END>  and  <START:test>  abdominal cavity  <END>  entered in the usual manner . Given  <START:treatment>  the patient 's previous surgery  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  some very thick vascular adhesions  <END>  were noted of the large and small bowel to the posterior fundal surface of the uterus . <START:treatment>  A Balfour retractor  <END>  was placed with  <START:treatment>  the bladder blade  <END>  to keep the bladder out of the operative field . The bowel was packed with 3 moist lap sponges to keep it out of the pelvis . Dr . Doe performed extensive dissection of the posterior fundal surface of the uterus to free the posterior cul-de-sac so that we could proceed safely with  <START:treatment>  a hysterectomy  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The procedure  <END>  was started by grasping each of the round ligaments , grasping them and dividing them and opening the anterior peritoneal leaflet and bringing it down across the lower uterine segment . The retroperitoneal space was then opened and each ureter identified on both sides to ensure that they were far out of the operative field intraoperatively . The infundibulopelvic ligaments were then identified and grasped with  <START:treatment>  Heaney clamps  <END>  x2 . These were then transected and  <START:treatment>  suture  <END>  ligated with  <START:treatment>  0-Vicryl suture  <END>  .
The gallbladder was carefully and tediously dissected down off the lower uterine segment , as it was thought to be fairly thickly adhered to the lower uterine segment .  <START:treatment>  Heaney clamps  <END>  were then used to come across the broad ligaments and the uterine arteries . These were then transected and  <START:treatment>  suture  <END>  ligated with  <START:treatment>  0-Vicryl suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Heaney clamps  <END>  were then placed serially down to the level of the uterosacral ligaments , which were then transected and  <START:treatment>  suture  <END>  ligated with  <START:treatment>  0-Vicryl suture  <END>  . The vagina was then entered sharply with  <START:treatment>  a scalpel  <END>  , then  <START:treatment>  Jorgenson scissors  <END>  was used to amputate the cervix and uterus with  <START:problem>  tubes and ovaries from the vaginal cuff  <END>  . There were several small pieces of what was thought to be cervix that remained and these were then removed with  <START:treatment>  Mayo scissors  <END>  using  <START:problem>  sharp dissection  <END>  and also to submit the specimens for  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The vaginal cuff  <END>  was then grasped with long Kochers . Corner stitches of  <START:treatment>  0-Vicryl suture  <END>  were then placed and  <START:treatment>  the vaginal cuff  <END>  closed with  <START:treatment>  an 0-Vicryl suture  <END>  in a running interlocking fashion . The pelvis was then irrigated with  <START:problem>  copious amounts of warm normal saline  <END>  . There were several areas of  <START:problem>  oozing noted on the vaginal cuff  <END>  , and these were hemostatically secured using figure-of-eight stitches of 3-0 chromic and 2-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl sutures  <END>  . When excellent hemostasis had been achieved , the pelvis was irrigated one final time ,  <START:problem>  all operative sites  <END>  inspected and  <START:treatment>  excellent hemostasis  <END>  noted . The muscles were then reapproximated using simple stitches of  <START:treatment>  0-Vicryl suture  <END>  . The fascia was then closed with 0-Maxon in a running non-interlocking stitch in 2 segments . The skin was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  warm normal saline  <END>  . Electrocautery was used for  <START:treatment>  hemostasis  <END>  . The skin was finally reapproximated using a running subcuticular stitch of 3-0 undyed  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Tincture  <END>  of  <START:treatment>  benzoin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were applied to  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  . The patient returned to the recovery room postoperatively with  <START:treatment>  all sponge and instrument counts  <END>  found to be correct .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Right thyroid nodule  <END>  . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS :  <START:problem>  Right thyroid nodule  <END>  . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Right thyroid lobectomy  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old who has a history of having had  <START:treatment>  previous thyroid surgery  <END>  for  <START:problem>  a right-sided nodule  <END>  . Recently ,  <START:problem>  the nodule of the right thyroid lobe  <END>  has been increasing in size and now has  <START:problem>  a mass  <END>  that is firm and hard and is about 3 . 5 cm in size .  <START:test>  Recent fine needle aspirate  <END>  revealed evidence of  <START:problem>  Hashimoto 's thyroiditis  <END>  without  <START:problem>  malignancy  <END>  . However , because of the fact that he has had  <START:problem>  undiagnosed nodule  <END>  previously resected and the fact that he has got  <START:problem>  an expanding nodule  <END>  in the right lobe , we feel that he needs  <START:treatment>  neck exploration  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  removal  <END>  of this lobe , and if malignant , removal probably of the other lobe . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : With the patient under  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia  <END>  , the neck and the upper chest were sterilely prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  and draped .
 <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was then carried down through the subcutaneous tissues using  <START:treatment>  the needle tip cautery through the platysma  <END>  and the strap muscles exposed . A couple of small vessels were ligated in the process .  <START:treatment>  The strap muscles  <END>  were opened in the midline and then the left lobe exposed slightly and palpated and felt totally normal , except for little tiny cystic nodules of about 0 . 5 cm in size . On the right side , the strap muscles were dissected away from the gland . Some of the muscles were actually adherent to the gland and required cutting the portion of the strap muscles away to include with the specimen in case this was a malignant process .  <START:treatment>  The Harmonic scalpel  <END>  was used in the dissection in addition to blunt  <START:problem>  dissection  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  hemostat  <END>  . The upper pole was mobilized . In the superior pole , all the vessels were taken with  <START:test>  the Harmonic scalpel  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The dissection  <END>  stayed on the thyroid gland at all times . The recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified in its normal position going into a mass of  <START:problem>  the scar tissue  <END>  and we did not dissect it out through that because of concerns for injury in the nerve . Therefore , we stayed on the gland and tried to avoid going into the area where the nerve appeared to be running .  <START:treatment>  Parathyroid glands  <END>  were identified in the superior and inferior and left intact . The middle thyroid artery was identified and was transected with  <START:treatment>  Harmonic scalpel  <END>  . The gland was mobilized medially . It was intermittently adherent to the trachea and care was taken to dissect it away as gingerly as possible . There was no  <START:problem>  significant bleeding  <END>  during  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  once the lobe had been totally removed and sent for  <START:test>  frozen section  <END>  and  <START:test>  the frozen section  <END>  diagnosis was  <START:problem>  chronic scarred colloid goiter  <END>  with no evidence of  <START:problem>  malignant changes  <END>  .
Because of that and the fact that we were concerned of both the viability of the parathyroid glands having been exposed and manipulated and also concerned about the status of  <START:problem>  the recurrent laryngeal nerve  <END>  , we decided to not remove the left lobe , especially since no  <START:problem>  malignancy  <END>  had been identified . The left lobe was explored , and as stated , it did show evidence of  <START:problem>  a small colloid cyst in 2 areas  <END>  , but the rest of the gland appeared to be normal .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was dry with  <START:problem>  minimal bleeding  <END>  at this point and was then closed primarily with 3-0 Vicryl for  <START:treatment>  the strap muscles  <END>  , 3-0 Vicryl subcutaneous for  <START:problem>  the main incision  <END>  with some interrupted  <START:treatment>  subcuticular 3-0 Vicryl sutures  <END>  and then a running 4-0 Vicryl with  <START:treatment>  Dermabond  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  the final skin closure  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well , was awakened from  <START:treatment>  the anesthetic  <END>  , extubated in the operating room without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition .

After adequate general  <START:treatment>  endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  by  <START:treatment>  the anesthesia  <END>  team , the table was turned 90 degrees .  <START:treatment>  A doughnut shoulder roll  <END>  was placed below the patient . The patient was draped in the usual fashion . Crowe-Davis mouth gag was used to expose the oropharynx . The right tonsil was grasped with  <START:treatment>  the tonsil tenaculum  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Bovie cautery  <END>  was used to remove the right tonsil and the plane of the peritonsillar capsule . There was  <START:problem>  minimal bleeding  <END>  . The left tonsil was then grasped .  <START:treatment>  Bovie cautery  <END>  was used to remove the tonsil and the plane of the peritonsillar capsule . This was a fairly large tonsil , extended along the posterior pharyngeal wall slightly . It was removed in its entirety .  <START:problem>  The old abscess cavity  <END>  was seen as a scarred-up area . No  <START:problem>  purulence  <END>  was present in it . Once this was totally removed , both areas were irrigated and suctioned vigorously with  <START:treatment>  Yankauer suction  <END>  . There seemed to be  <START:problem>  a small vein running  <END>  through the posterior aspect of the tonsillar fossa on the left side , so a 4-0 Vicryl stitch was then thrown in  <START:treatment>  a figure-of-eight fashion  <END>  around this for prevention of  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  postoperatively . Once this was done , again , both tonsillar fossae were roughened up by  <START:test>  digital palpation  <END>  and no  <START:problem>  bleeding  <END>  was provoked . The stomach was suctioned .  <START:problem>  Crowe-Davis mouth gag  <END>  was removed . The patient was allowed to awaken from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  .

In a similar fashion , the right tonsil was grasped with  <START:treatment>  an Allis clamp  <END>  , retracted medially and excised using  <START:treatment>  Bovie cautery  <END>  . The patient was noted to have  <START:problem>  marked redundancy of the pharynx  <END>  and  <START:problem>  marked lymphoid hypertrophy  <END>  including  <START:problem>  very prominent lateral pharyngeal bands  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  The red rubber catheter  <END>  was passed through  <START:problem>  the right nasal cavity  <END>  , initially could not be passed through the left because of  <START:problem>  the obstructing adenoids  <END>  . Looking with  <START:treatment>  a mirror  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  the adenoid pad  <END>  was cauterized , and eventually ,  <START:treatment>  the red rubber  <END>  could be passed through  <START:problem>  the left nasal cavity  <END>  and was brought out and secured with  <START:treatment>  a Kelly clamp  <END>  .  <START:test>  Further palpation  <END>  revealed  <START:problem>  continued marked enlargement  <END>  . Using  <START:treatment>  an adenoid curette  <END>  , the bulk of the adenoid pad was excised . The nasopharynx was packed with  <START:treatment>  tonsil sponges  <END>  .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was taken to the operative suite and put supine on the operating room table . The patient was put to sleep using  <START:treatment>  an oral endotracheal tube  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A Crowe-Davis mouth gag  <END>  was inserted and suspended from the Mayo stand .  <START:treatment>  A Blair drape  <END>  was placed .  <START:treatment>  A red rubber catheter  <END>  was inserted through the nasal cavity and used to elevate the soft palate .
The nasopharynx was examined using a mirror and headlight . The adenoid pad was found to be enlarged and was removed using  <START:treatment>  a suction cautery technique  <END>  . This area was packed with  <START:treatment>  gauze sponges  <END>  . Attention was then turned to the right tonsil , which was grasped with  <START:treatment>  an Allis clamp  <END>  and dissected from the underlying constrictor muscle of the pharynx using a coagulating Bovie current . The left tonsil was similarly grasped and removed using the same coagulating Bovie current .  <START:problem>  Bleeding  <END>  in both tonsil areas was controlled with  <START:treatment>  suction Bovie  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Packing  <END>  was removed from the nasopharynx and bleeding was controlled in this area using  <START:treatment>  a suction Bovie cauterizing the entire adenoid  <END>  bed . The entire pharynx was then copiously irrigated with  <START:treatment>  sterile saline  <END>  . With no  <START:problem>  significant bleeding  <END>  , the patient was awakened ,  <START:problem>  the Crowe-Davis mouth gag  <END>  was removed .

OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Trabeculectomy  <END>  , right eye . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : Local using solution of equal parts of 2 %  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  and 0 . 75 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  . The patient was also given  <START:treatment>  general anesthesia standby  <END>  . INDICATIONS : To  <START:treatment>  control glaucoma  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : After the patient was given  <START:treatment>  a peribulbar local anesthetic injection  <END>  , she was routinely prepped and draped .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips  <END>  were used to separate the right eyelids .  <START:treatment>  A 6-0 Vicryl suture  <END>  was passed through the clear cornea just in front of the limbus at the 12 o'clock position as  <START:treatment>  a traction suture  <END>  to rotate the eyeball downwards . The conjunctiva and Tenon capsule were then incised with  <START:treatment>  the tenotomy scissors  <END>  8 to 10 mm posterior to the limbus from 10 to 12 to 2 o'clock positions .
 <START:problem>  The dissection  <END>  was carried forward until the limbus was reached .  <START:problem>  Bleeding  <END>  was controlled with  <START:treatment>  wet-field cautery  <END>  . We also elected to use the 6-0 Vicryl suture through the tendon of the right superior rectus muscle as  <START:treatment>  a further traction suture  <END>  to get  <START:problem>  better exposure  <END>  . We noted that from  <START:treatment>  her previous cataract surgery  <END>  , which was done many years ago , that there were still holes in the sclerae at about the 12 o'clock ; therefore , we elected to do  <START:problem>  the sclerotomy flap slightly on the nasal side  <END>  , that is in  <START:problem>  the superior nasal quadrant  <END>  . Superblade was used to outline  <START:problem>  the sclerotomy incision  <END>  measuring 2 . 8 mm in width and extending 2-3 mm posteriorly . At this point ,  <START:treatment>  2 corneal shield sponges  <END>  were soaked in 0 . 3 mg / mL of  <START:treatment>  mitomycin C  <END>  . These were placed under the conjunctiva and Tenon capsule and held there for a period of 1 minute . Then , the sponges were properly disposed off and the entire area copiously irrigated with  <START:treatment>  balanced salt solution  <END>  . The retina was protected throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a corneal shield  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  The crescent knife blade  <END>  was used to dissect the scleral flap until the limbus was reached . We then used  <START:treatment>  a 27 gauge needle to enter the anterior chamber under the sclerotomy flap  <END>  . We also injected a small amount of regular Healon into the anterior chamber to maintain the chamber . The Express shunt was then inserted through the preplaced opening . This was done without  <START:problem>  any problems  <END>  . We noticed that  <START:problem>  aqueous immediately flowed out of the eye  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The sclerotomy flap  <END>  was then closed with multiple interrupted 10-0  <START:treatment>  nylon sutures  <END>  . On the temporal corner , we used  <START:treatment>  the 10-0 nylon suture  <END>  and tied it with a slipknot with the proximal end of  <START:treatment>  the suture  <END>  coming out under the conjunctivae to make sure the clear cornea in front of the limbus . We checked  <START:treatment>  this sclerotomy flap very carefully  <END>  and were satisfied that there was no  <START:problem>  obvious leakage  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The traction suture  <END>  through the superior rectus muscle tendon was then released . The conjunctiva and Tenon capsule were then closed very tightly using a running interlocking 8-0  <START:treatment>  Vicryl suture  <END>  to make  <START:problem>  the watertight wound  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The corneal shield  <END>  was removed and  <START:treatment>  the corneal traction suture  <END>  was also removed . At the end of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  , we noticed that the anterior chamber was deep and clear . These have been partially filled with regular Healon . The eye was then irrigated with 20 mg of  <START:treatment>  Garamycin  <END>  and 0 . 5 mL of  <START:treatment>  Celestone  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Maxitrol ointment  <END>  was instilled .  <START:treatment>  Steri-Strips and drapes  <END>  were removed and the eye was covered with  <START:treatment>  a dry dressing  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Fox metal shield  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  very well and left the operating room in good condition .

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : Following  <START:treatment>  satisfactory oral endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  placement of the Budde halo  <END>  with  <START:test>  electrophysiological monitoring  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  an expanded right postaural incision  <END>  was outlined and injected with  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  1 : 100 , 000  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  . The abdomen was also prepped out for anticipated harvest of  <START:treatment>  a fat graft  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Postaural incision  <END>  was made and carried down through the skin and  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissue  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A beveled pericranial flap  <END>  was developed anteriorly .
The mastoid cortex was exposed , and with the flaps held forthwith with  <START:treatment>  Weitlaner retractors  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Raney clips  <END>  placed along  <START:problem>  the posterior flap incision margin  <END>  using  <START:treatment>  continuous otomicroscopic visualization  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  suction irrigation  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  a cutting bur  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  cortical mastoidectomy  <END>  was done . The tegumen was identified superiorly .  <START:problem>  The sigmoid sinus  <END>  was identified posteriorly and sinodural angle was saucerized to the aditus ad antrum .  <START:problem>  Horizontal canal , lateral process  <END>  and incus were identified . The vertical segment of the facial nerve was now skeletonized from the stylomastoid foramen with the facial recess in the mesotympanum space .  <START:treatment>  Perilabyrinthine cells  <END>  were decorticated .  <START:test>  The infralabyrinthine tracts  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  retrofacial cell tract  <END>  was opened to the jugular bulb .  <START:treatment>  The bone over the tegumen plate  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  posterior fossa plate  <END>  and sigmoid sinus was now decorticated with  <START:treatment>  diamond polishing bur  <END>  and removed .  <START:treatment>  Retrosigmoid bone  <END>  was taken down to the level of the dura to allow for adequate decompression of  <START:treatment>  the sigmoid sinus  <END>  .
With the patient site and side identification done ,  <START:treatment>  an organized labyrinthectomy  <END>  was performed . The horizontal canal was followed to the posterior , to the common crus and superior canal . The vestibule was opened . Bone was decorticated inferiorly as well as up along the tegumen plate . At the lamina cribrosa , the lateral point of the internal auditory canal was now identified and the internal auditory canal was skeletonized 270 degrees around . Bone was decorticated with  <START:treatment>  a diamond polishing bur  <END>  and removed from  <START:problem>  all dural surfaces  <END>  . Ventrally Kawase triangle was opened widely as was the airspace inferior to the IAC . Under high power magnification , using  <START:problem>  a small diamond bur  <END>  , the facial nerve was decompressed through the geniculate to the labyrinthine segment and into the internal auditory canal .  <START:test>  Bill 's bar  <END>  was palpated . The superior vestibular nerve was sectioned . The facial nerve was noted to be intimately effaced by tumor and it was decompressed down to the porus acusticus .  <START:problem>  The cochlear  <END>  and  <START:problem>  inferior vestibular nerves  <END>  were likewise sectioned and removed .  <START:treatment>  Hemostasis  <END>  was achieved with  <START:treatment>  bipolar cautery  <END>  . At the conclusion of  <START:problem>  the neurosurgical dissection  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the capsule  <END>  was left intimately juxtaposing and very adherent to the facial nerve .  <START:problem>  A small attendant piece  <END>  of the brainstem could not be safely removed . The abdomen on the right lower quadrant was prepared and  <START:treatment>  the abdominal fat  <END>  was harvested .  <START:problem>  The wound site  <END>  was hemostased and closed in layers over  <START:treatment>  a Penrose drain  <END>  . Bone wax was now used to pack into Kawase space as well as exposed pneumatized tracts .  <START:treatment>  The temporalis muscle graft  <END>  was harvested and  <START:problem>  muscle pieces  <END>  were packed into the epitympanum and added to this area .
 <START:treatment>  Bone wax sealed laterally and bone wax  <END>  was applied liberally over the posterior canal wall , as well as the area of the mastoid tip .  <START:treatment>  Strips of abdominal fat  <END>  were now tucked into the dural defect and contoured in to fill the mastoid cavity .  <START:treatment>  Tisseel  <END>  was applied . The Palva flap was returned to  <START:problem>  its anatomic position and the 3-layer Palva flap  <END>  , subcutaneous and  <START:treatment>  skin closure  <END>  was accomplished .  <START:treatment>  A dry sterile compressive mastoid dressing  <END>  was applied .

SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : Local /  <START:problem>  MAC  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room and positioned on the operating room table .  <START:test>  Cardiac and blood pressure monitoring devices  <END>  were applied .  <START:treatment>  Intravenous sedatives  <END>  were administered and  <START:problem>  retrobulbar  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  supratrochlear injections  <END>  of 2 %  <START:treatment>  Carbocaine plain  <END>  was administered for the left eye without  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  . The patient was prepped and draped in the usual fashion for  <START:treatment>  a procedure of the left eye  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A lid speculum  <END>  was inserted between the lids of the eye to expose the eye .  <START:treatment>  Transconjunctival traction sutures  <END>  were passed through  <START:treatment>  the insertions of the superior  <END>  and inferior rectus muscles to serve as  <START:treatment>  traction sutures  <END>  during  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  .
 <START:treatment>  A limited conjunctival peritomy  <END>  was created in the superonasal quadrant and the conjunctiva was reflected to reveal the bare sclera in that region . At a measured 3 . 5 mm from the limbus , in the 9 : 30 meridian ,  <START:problem>  a partial thickness scleral incision  <END>  was created parallel to the limbus .  <START:test>  The biopsy  <END>  was then performed using 25 gauge long hollow lumen needle attached via a sterile connector tubing to a 10 mL aspirating syringe . Prior to introduction of the tip of  <START:treatment>  the needle  <END>  , the needle shaft was bent just above its tip to the appropriate angle for the position of  <START:problem>  the intraocular tumor  <END>  . The tip of  <START:treatment>  the needle  <END>  was inserted into the eye via  <START:problem>  the partial thickness scleral incision  <END>  mentioned above . The tip of the needle was slowly passed through  <START:test>  the vitreous  <END>  and into the substance of  <START:problem>  the choroidal tumor under indirect ophthalmoscopic visualization  <END>  . Once  <START:problem>  the tumor  <END>  had been impaled by the tip ,  <START:problem>  aspiration  <END>  was performed by the surgical assistant repeatedly . The needle was then withdrawn from the eye .  <START:problem>  Minimal bleeding  <END>  occurred at the puncture site into the tumor . The process was repeated with  <START:treatment>  two additional fresh needles  <END>  , each sampling a slightly different site within the tumor . Once the third needle pass had been completed ,  <START:treatment>  a 7-0 Vicryl suture  <END>  was used to close  <START:problem>  the partial thickness scleral incision  <END>  . The conjunctiva was closed with  <START:treatment>  interrupted sutures  <END>  of 7-0 Vicryl .  <START:treatment>  The traction sutures  <END>  were cut and removed .  <START:treatment>  The speculum  <END>  was removed .  <START:treatment>  Bacitracin-Polymyxin ointment  <END>  was applied to the surface of the eye . The lids were patched with  <START:treatment>  a sterile eye pad dressing  <END>  . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well and was transferred back to same day surgery in satisfactory condition for  <START:treatment>  postoperative care  <END>  .

OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:treatment>  Right tympanoplasty  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  mastoidectomy  <END>  ,  <START:test>  facial nerve electromyogram  <END>  , facial nerve monitoring , use of  <START:treatment>  operating microscope  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General . DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the supine position .  <START:treatment>  General endotracheal anesthesia  <END>  was administered and the table was turned .  <START:test>  A facial nerve EMG  <END>  was obtained .  <START:treatment>  Electrodes  <END>  were placed in the orbicularis oris and  <START:problem>  orbicularis  <END>  oculi muscles .  <START:test>  The facial nerve EMG  <END>  was then monitored throughout the remaining portion of the case . At this time ,  <START:treatment>  the microscope  <END>  was draped in sterile plastic .  <START:treatment>  The microscope  <END>  was used to visualize during the drilling .  <START:treatment>  Lidocaine  <END>  1 % with 1 : 100 , 000  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was injected into the postauricular crease and into the ear canal . As we looked into the ear canal , we could not really tell ; it looked like there was a significant retraction up into the epitympanic space . At this time ,  <START:problem>  a postauricular incision  <END>  was created . There was  <START:problem>  scar  <END>  in this area and the scar was actually cut out .  <START:problem>  The postauricular incision  <END>  was then carried down to temporalis fascia .  <START:treatment>  A temporalis fascial graft  <END>  was obtained . There was quite  <START:problem>  a bit of bleeding  <END>  and the patient bled quite  <START:problem>  a bit throughout the entire case  <END>  . At this time ,  <START:treatment>  periosteal flaps  <END>  were elevated .  <START:treatment>  The previous mastoidectomy  <END>  was entered . We then elevated the skin in the ear canal .  <START:problem>  A vascular strip incision  <END>  was created . At this time , the ear was flipped forward .  <START:problem>  The anterior canal skin  <END>  was then  <START:problem>  elevated  <END>  .  <START:test>  A protecter  <END>  was used on the canal skin . The ear canal was enlarged with a series of  <START:treatment>  cutting  <END>  and  <START:problem>  diamond drill bits  <END>  . At this time , there was  <START:problem>  some bleeding up in the temporal area  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A piece of Surgicel  <END>  was placed over this to stop  <START:problem>  the bleeding  <END>  . At this time , the mastoid was opened . As we opened up the mastoid , we found tissue that kept looking like it was dura . As we opened this up , we found it was just  <START:problem>  an inflamed air cell  <END>  . We continued opening this up until we found the antrum . At this time , we finally found the antrum and were able to drill down by following the dura down into the antrum area . There was  <START:problem>  a quite a bit of new bone formation  <END>  . There was  <START:problem>  a quite a bit of scar tissue  <END>  up in the mastoid antrum .  <START:problem>  The scar tissue  <END>  was actually taken out and sent for specimen . It was unclear if this was  <START:problem>  cholesteatoma  <END>  or  <START:problem>  just scar tissue  <END>  . At this time , the middle ear space was then entered . We noticed that the skin of the ear was very stuck down to the annulus so therefore we cut the skin of the ear canal out and then enlarged the ear canal with a series of  <START:problem>  diamond drill bits  <END>  . At this time , the middle ear space was entered . There was  <START:problem>  some purulence in the middle ear space  <END>  down into the sinus tympani area . We were able to elevate the drum up . As we elevated the drum up , we could see the patient had  <START:treatment>  a previous atticotomy procedure  <END>  performed . At this time , we then explored the area where the incus and stapes was . The malleus was actually retracted down to the drum . It appeared that  <START:problem>  the drum head  <END>  was down on top of  <START:treatment>  the stapes  <END>  , but we could not tell if the stapes was actually intact . The chorda tympani was sacrificed . The long process of the incus was actually destroyed and there was  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  in this area . It was unclear if this was  <START:problem>  cholesteatoma  <END>  or  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  . At this time ,  <START:problem>  the head of the malleus  <END>  was removed and the incus was removed . There was quite  <START:problem>  a bit of scar tissue  <END>  over the area where the incus was . It appeared that the incus had actually disintegrated into  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  . Because it was unclear where the facial nerve was ,  <START:problem>  the facial nerve stimulator  <END>  was brought out . The facial nerve stimulator was initially set at 0 . 05 and slowly increased until 3 milliamps was used . The facial nerve was actually stimulated at that and was found to be under the bone in the normal position .  <START:problem>  The scar tissue  <END>  was therefore removed . The area of the stapes was not explored because of the concern about  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  and all of  <START:problem>  the inflammation  <END>  . As a result of this , we went ahead and put thick Silastic into the middle ear space .  <START:treatment>  A lateral surface grafting technique  <END>  was utilized with  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  placed lateral to the annulus and medial to the malleus .  <START:problem>  The anterior canal skin  <END>  was returned to its normal position .  <START:problem>  The postauricular incision  <END>  was then closed in layers .  <START:problem>  A vascular strip incision  <END>  was placed down into the ear canal . There was quite  <START:problem>  a bit of scar tissue  <END>  over the area where the incus was . It appeared that the incus had actually disintegrated into  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  . Because it was unclear where the facial nerve was ,  <START:problem>  the facial nerve stimulator  <END>  was brought out . The facial nerve stimulator was initially set at 0 . 05 and slowly increased until 3 milliamps was used . The facial nerve was actually stimulated at that and was found to be under the bone in the normal position .  <START:problem>  The scar tissue  <END>  was therefore removed . The area of the stapes was not explored because of the concern about  <START:problem>  scar tissue  <END>  and all of  <START:problem>  the inflammation  <END>  . As a result of this , we went ahead and put thick Silastic into the middle ear space .  <START:treatment>  A lateral surface grafting technique  <END>  was utilized with  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  placed lateral to the annulus and medial to the malleus .  <START:problem>  The anterior canal skin  <END>  was returned to its normal position .  <START:problem>  The postauricular incision  <END>  was then closed in layers .  <START:problem>  A vascular strip incision  <END>  was placed down into the ear canal . There was  <START:problem>  some bone pate  <END>  and we used this bone pate to actually obliterate the sinodural angle . At this time , the patient was awakened and taken to the recovery room in stable condition .

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Bladder calculus . POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS : Bladder calculus . OPERATION PERFORMED :  <START:problem>  Electrohydraulic lithotripsy of bladder calculus  <END>  . SURGEON : John Doe , MD ANESTHESIA : General LMA . ANESTHESIOLOGIST : Jane Doe , MD INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : A patient with  <START:problem>  a large bladder calculus  <END>  , status post  <START:problem>  colon cancer  <END>  , who is referred for  <START:problem>  evaluation of bladder neck obstruction and bladder calculus  <END>  . The patient was counseled about breaking up the stone using laser and EHL modality .  <START:treatment>  The risks and problems of the procedure  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  indwelling catheter  <END>  were explained to the patient and he was in agreement . PROCEDURE IN DETAIL : After the patient was brought to  <START:treatment>  the surgical suite  <END>  and placed on the surgical table , he was given  <START:treatment>  Cipro  <END>  . He had some burning initially , but then it stopped .  <START:treatment>  Residual Cipro  <END>  was given in the operating room , after which the patient was then given  <START:treatment>  general LMA anesthesia  <END>  . He was placed in  <START:treatment>  the dorsal lithotomy position  <END>  , prepped with  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  and draped in aseptic fashion . Then , 2 %  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  was infused into urethra . At this point , the patient had  <START:treatment>  cystoscopy  <END>  which revealed a normal urethra but the prostate fossa was a long , 3 cm fossa with intrusion of the lateral lobe into the fossa . The prostate pushed and deviated to the left side .  <START:problem>  The bladder  <END>  was  <START:problem>  a very small contracted bladder  <END>  . There was  <START:treatment>  a large stone  <END>  , greater than approximately 3 cm , after which the resectoscope was assembled and the working element was not used but the scope was used with extension in order to place the EHL fiber . Once the fiber was introduced , we were able to break up the stone in small fragments . After approximately 15 to 20 minutes of breaking up the stone , we then were able to irrigate out the fragments without  <START:problem>  difficulty  <END>  .
At the end of  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the bladder  <END>  was cleaned of  <START:test>  all fragments  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A # 24 French catheter  <END>  was introduced into the bladder to decrease irritation postoperatively . The patient was then aroused and carried to the recovery room . In the recovery room , the patient had  <START:problem>  some stridor  <END>  and therefore was treated with  <START:treatment>  Alupent therapy  <END>  . He had  <START:problem>  some panic disorder  <END>  and therefore was treated with  <START:treatment>  Ativan  <END>  . The patient , upon stabilization , will be discharged to home with  <START:treatment>  his indwelling catheter  <END>  or if he is  <START:problem>  still having problems  <END>  , will be admitted to 23-hour stay . The patient is to follow up in the office in approximately 36 to 48 hours for removal of  <START:treatment>  his Foley catheter  <END>  .

SAMPLE #1 

INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old male who twisted his left ankle sustaining  <START:problem>  a trimalleolar ankle fracture dislocation  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The dislocation  <END>  was reduced in the emergency room and he was admitted for  <START:treatment>  elevation  <END>  , icing and  <START:treatment>  surgical stabilization  <END>  . We discussed with the patient and his family the procedure ,  <START:treatment>  the postoperative protocol  <END>  and that he will be 6 weeks nonweightbearing . We discussed  <START:treatment>  the risks  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  benefits  <END>  which include but are not limited to ,  <START:problem>  infection  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  nonunion  <END>  ,  <START:treatment>  malunion  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  DVT  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  PE  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  neurovascular damage  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  tendinous damage , metal failure  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  future joint arthrosis  <END>  , and  <START:problem>  even loss of life  <END>  or limb . They understand all these and agreed to proceed . 

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was brought to the operating room and laid supine on the operating room table .  <START:problem>  All bony prominences  <END>  were well padded .  <START:treatment>  A thigh tourniquet  <END>  was applied to the left lower extremity .  <START:treatment>  IV antibiotics  <END>  were administered preoperatively .  <START:treatment>  An epidural anesthetic  <END>  was placed and then supplemented with general during  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The left lower extremity splint  <END>  was removed . There was still evidence of  <START:problem>  moderate swelling  <END>  and  <START:problem>  ecchymosis  <END>  . Medially , there was  <START:problem>  a fracture blister proximal to the medial malleolus  <END>  and  <START:problem>  the medial incision  <END>  was kept below  <START:problem>  the fracture blister  <END>  . Laterally , there was  <START:problem>  a fracture blister along the anterior edge of the distal fibula  <END>  , and in this area ,  <START:problem>  the incision  <END>  was kept posterior to  <START:problem>  the fracture blister  <END>  . His left lower extremity was prepped with  <START:treatment>  DuraPrep  <END>  and then draped out in the usual sterile fashion . The limb was exsanguinated using an Esmarch and  <START:treatment>  tourniquet  <END>  inflated to 300 mmHg 

 <START:problem>  A longitudinal incision  <END>  was made centering over the distal fibula posteriorly .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was carried down through the skin and  <START:problem>  subcutaneous tissues  <END>  . The underlying fibula was palpated and then the dissection was carried directly down on to bone .  <START:treatment>  Full-thickness flaps  <END>  were raised in the anterior and posterior direction exposing the distal fibula .  <START:problem>  The distal fibula fracture  <END>  was  <START:problem>  very comminuted  <END>  . There were  <START:problem>  several fracture lines  <END>  . There was  <START:problem>  a longitudinal split  <END>  that extended proximally leaving a separate rectangular fragment posteriorly . There was also  <START:problem>  a transverse component  <END>  leaving only  <START:problem>  a very small fracture  <END>  fragmented with  <START:problem>  very distal tip  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The different fracture lines  <END>  were reduced with  <START:treatment>  the clamps  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The fracture  <END>  was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  antibiotic solution  <END>  and  <START:problem>  all the hematoma  <END>  removed .  <START:treatment>  Two screws  <END>  were placed from anterior to posterior . These were placed in a lag fashion by drilling the proximal cortex with a 3 . 5 mm drill bit and the second cortex with the 2 . 5 mm drill bit . The first one was placed more proximally from an 

 <START:problem>  A 7-hole one-third tubular plate  <END>  was then contoured to sit along the lateral cortex as  <START:treatment>  a buttress plate  <END>  . It was positioned so as to be able to capture as much of the cortex outside to  <START:problem>  the fracture line  <END>  . The 3 . 5  <START:treatment>  cortical screws  <END>  were placed in the plate proximally and 4 . 0  <START:treatment>  cancellous screws  <END>  distally . Each of these was drilled with a 2 . 5 mm drill bit .  <START:problem>  Appropriate length  <END>  measured with the depth gauge and  <START:treatment>  appropriate length screw  <END>  which were self-tapped in place . His bone was osteoporotic and soft distally and  <START:treatment>  the fixation  <END>  was difficult to achieve distally . The posterior fragment would not stay reduced with just the plate , so  <START:problem>  additional two 18 gauge malleable wires  <END>  were placed around the distal fibula and tightened down to hold this in place . The ends of the wire were bent down posteriorly .  <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was then irrigated with  <START:treatment>  antibiotic solution  <END>  and visualized under  <START:test>  the C-arm fluoroscopy  <END>  . The distal fibular fragment had been reduced . All the metal appeared to be in good position . The mortise was now reduced also . 

Our attention was then turned medially and  <START:problem>  a longitudinal incision  <END>  was made from the fracture over the tip of the lateral malleolus .  <START:problem>  The incision  <END>  was carried down through the skin and then the subcutaneous tissue was gently divided with  <START:treatment>  tenotomy scissors  <END>  down on to bone .  <START:problem>  The periosteum  <END>  had flipped between  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  . This was debrided out .  <START:problem>  The fracture fragment  <END>  was opened and then  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  and the joint irrigated with  <START:treatment>  antibiotic solution  <END>  . There were  <START:problem>  several cartilaginous fragments  <END>  indicating  <START:problem>  some damage within the joint  <END>  . These were already debrided . The medial malleolus fragment was then reduced and held in place with  <START:treatment>  a sharp hook  <END>  . The 4 . 0 cannulated  <START:treatment>  screw system  <END>  was used next .  <START:treatment>  Two guide pins  <END>  were placed from the tip of the fragment into the distal tibia .  <START:problem>  These K-wires  <END>  were placed under  <START:test>  C-arm fluoroscopy  <END>  and the position verified to be across  <START:problem>  the fracture  <END>  and holding  <START:problem>  the fracture in alignment  <END>  . The 44 mm lag screw was chosen by the cannulated depth gauge . Using one at a time , a 2 . 7 mm drill bit was used 

 <START:problem>  The wound  <END>  was again irrigated with  <START:treatment>  antibiotic solution  <END>  . Both medially and laterally ,  <START:problem>  the fascial layers  <END>  were repaired with  <START:treatment>  figure-of-eight 0 Vicryl stitch  <END>  . The subcutaneous tissues were closed with 2-0 Vicryl in both sides due to  <START:problem>  the poor skin quality  <END>  . The incisions were closed with 3-0  <START:treatment>  nylon vertical mattress sutures  <END>  .  <START:problem>  All the wounds and fracture blisters  <END>  were covered with  <START:treatment>  Xeroform  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  A sterile compressive dressing  <END>  was applied with 4 x 4 's , Webril and then a posterior splint applied and secured down with  <START:problem>  an Ace wrap  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The tourniquet  <END>  was deflated after total of 105 minutes . The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well and was awoken from  <START:treatment>  anesthesia  <END>  and brought to the recovery room in stable condition . 

SAMPLE #2 

 <START:problem>  OPERATIVE FINDINGS  <END>  : 1 . Thick-walled vein ,  <START:problem>  clotted at anastomotic site  <END>  , was thick walled proximally as well . 2 .  <START:treatment>  Thrombectomy catheter  <END>  was easily passed and did not retrieve  <START:problem>  any thrombus  <END>  . 3 .  <START:problem>  The anastomosis  <END>  was advanced to the more proximal axillary vein . 

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : This patient is a ( XX ) -year-old gentleman who has  <START:problem>  renal insufficiency  <END>  and requires likely  <START:treatment>  nephrectomy  <END>  . The patient presents for  <START:treatment>  graft placement  <END>  . Risks , indications and technique had been discussed . The patient underwent  <START:treatment>  graft placement last week  <END>  . Unfortunately , it clotted . The patient now presents for  <START:treatment>  thrombectomy  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  revision  <END>  . It was noted on  <START:treatment>  the initial procedure  <END>  that the vein was thick walled , but it was felt that it was adequate for grafting . This was consistent with  <START:problem>  chronic thrombosis  <END>  . The patient denies any history of this having been an issue before . 

The patient tolerated  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  well , stable to PACU with  <START:problem>  a weak thrill in the AV graft  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  palpable radial pulse  <END>  . DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was brought to the operating room , was identified as the correct patient and was placed supine on the operating room table .  <START:problem>  LMA anesthesia  <END>  was induced and he was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion with his left arm at a 90-degree angle to the torso .  <START:treatment>  Local anesthetic  <END>  1 % lidocaine mixed with 0 . 5 %  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  epinephrine  <END>  was used to anesthetize the operative field .  <START:problem>  The old incision  <END>  was opened . This was actually extended more proximally on the arm .  <START:problem>  Dissection of the vein  <END>  was performed to the more proximal level . The graft was noted to be completely decompressed .  <START:treatment>  The anastomotic sutures  <END>  were taken down . The vein had no  <START:problem>  forward  <END>  or backbleeding from  <START:problem>  this site  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Thrombectomy catheter  <END>  was then passed proximally towards the central veins . It was withdrawn . There was noted to be thickened wall to this . However , it did appear to extend 

There was noted to be thickened wall to this . However , it did appear to extend mildly . It was thought that  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  should be brought more proximally on the vein . The distal end had no flow through it and therefore this was ligated .  <START:treatment>  The graft  <END>  was then thrombectomized using a 4 French Fogarty  <START:treatment>  embolectomy catheter  <END>  . The bullet was withdrawn . Decent inflow was achieved . The vein had been transected after it had been ligated , and  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  was performed using a 6-0 Prolene beginning at the heel and run circumferentially . Prior to completion of  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  , it was de-aired and reasonable inflow was again noted .  <START:treatment>  A 4 French embolectomy catheter  <END>  was easily passed through this area and withdrew absolutely no  <START:problem>  clot  <END>  . The area was irrigated with  <START:treatment>  heparinized saline solution  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  the anastomosis  <END>  was completed . There was  <START:problem>  a weak  <END>  but palpable thrill on  <START:treatment>  the graft  <END>  and  <START:test>  a palpable radial pulse  <END>  .  <START:problem>  The wounds  <END>  were irrigated and then repaired using 3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion to reapproximate the fascia followe 

INDICATIONS FOR PROCEDURE : The patient is a ( XX ) -year-old gentleman seen for  <START:treatment>  vasectomy consultation  <END>  . The patient had been a given  <START:treatment>  a vasectomy instruction packet  <END>  and had explained the procedure to him as well as the potential risks and  <START:problem>  complications  <END>  . No results were guaranteed and he understood , agreed and signed the operative permit . 

DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE : The patient was in the supine position . He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion . The left vas deferens was brought up under the left anterior hemiscrotal skin and the area overlying it infiltrated with 2 %  <START:treatment>  Xylocaine  <END>  .  <START:problem>  A 1 / 4 inch incision  <END>  was made over the left vas deferens and carried down through the skin and dartos muscle . The left vas deferens was grasped with  <START:treatment>  vasectomy clamp  <END>  and a segment was freed up and excised . The cut ends of the vas were occluded with  <START:treatment>  surgical clips  <END>  . The ends of the vas were electrocauterized and separated and allowed to drop back into the hemiscrotum .  <START:problem>  The skin incision  <END>  was closed with 2 sutures of 4-0  <START:treatment>  chromic catgut  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  The identical procedure  <END>  was performed on the right side for  <START:treatment>  right vasectomy  <END>  . The specimens were submitted to  <START:test>  pathology  <END>  for  <START:test>  examination  <END>  . The patient was instructed to continue using  <START:treatment>  birth control  <END>  and to see Dr .

DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION : The patient was prepped and draped in the usual aseptic manner and injected with  <START:treatment>  lidocaine  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  preoperatively .  <START:treatment>  Martin bandage  <END>  was used to exsanguinate the foot . Ankle tourniquet was inflated to 250 mmHg of  <START:treatment>  pressure to control hemostasis  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Classic dorsomedial incision  <END>  was made over the first ray , starting at the base of the distal phalanx and extending onto the first metatarsal cuneiform joint area .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was deepened and  <START:problem>  bleeding vessels  <END>  were bovied . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down to the capsular structures . Soft tissue was reflected medial and lateral , exposing the capsular structures of the first metatarsal and proximal phalanx .  <START:problem>  Standard classic incision  <END>  was then made through the capsule with  <START:problem>  a small portion of the capsule  <END>  being excised over the dorsomedial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint . Capsular structures were then undermined and reflected medially and laterally , exposing  <START:test>  the first metatarsal head , neck and shaft region  <END>  and the pro 
 
Attention was then directed to  <START:problem>  the first metatarsal head  <END>  . Medial eminence was cut and remodeled using a sagittal saw and  <START:problem>  a rotary bur  <END>  , at which time the high intermetatarsal angle was addressed using the  <START:problem>  FRS system  <END>  and performing  <START:problem>  a Z-osteotomy  <END>  with  <START:problem>  a K-wire oriented slightly dorsal third  <END>  , and it was angulated slightly distally from the medial aspect to the more distal lateral aspect slightly beyond the perpendicular to the first metatarsal itself . The second K-wire was oriented proximal plantar and near the base of  <START:problem>  the first metatarsal  <END>  , and this was angulated and placed perpendicular to the second metatarsal .  <START:problem>  Both K-wires  <END>  were angulated from dorsomedial to plantar lateral to allow for plantar flexion of the first metatarsal .  <START:treatment>  The osteotomy guide  <END>  was then introduced to facilitate the cut . A longitudinal arm was made and then the dorsal distal wing of  <START:test>  the osteotomy  <END>  was performed and the plantar proximal wing was performed . Upon completion , the capital fragment was easily shifted laterally , reducing the int 

Throughout  <START:treatment>  the procedure  <END>  ,  <START:problem>  the Fluoroscan  <END>  was used for  <START:test>  checking alignment  <END>  and positioning of the sesamoids . We had good alignment , good positioning and good range of motion . It was noted that the first metatarsal had a fair amount of erosion running along the groove , where the base of the proximal phalanx had been rubbing across the cartilage surface and eroded the cartilage down to a pink raw tissue on the cartilage , creating early  <START:problem>  degenerative joint disease  <END>  in that region . Once the positioning had taken place , the proximal phalanx was functioning better in the proper anatomical position and should prevent  <START:problem>  further degenerative joint disease  <END>  from occurring in the future . The foot was loaded . It was still noted that the intermetatarsal angle was in good position .  <START:problem>  Tibial sesamoid  <END>  was in excellent position , but there was still a fair amount of interphalangeus and still  <START:treatment>  an Akin osteotomy  <END>  was elected to be performed . 

 <START:treatment>  Akin osteotomy  <END>  was then performed with base distal medial and the apex proximal lateral and completed  <START:treatment>  osteotomy  <END>  with  <START:treatment>  a wedge of bone resected  <END>  . This was then feathered and the interphalangeus was then made into the proper position . Once it was felt adequate feathering had been performed , it was held in place with  <START:treatment>  the bone clamp  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  then 2 FRS screws  <END>  were introduced from medial to lateral , which allowed for  <START:problem>  compression of the osteotomy site  <END>  and good stabilization . At this time ,  <START:problem>  all bleeding vessels  <END>  were checked and bovied . The area was copiously flushed . Rotary bur was used to make all area that was sharp or irritating smooth and properly contoured . The foot was loaded . We had excellent range of motion , good positioning and again this was checked periodically with the Fluoroscan . The area was copiously flushed and then standard closure of capsule structures with 2-0 Dexon , subcutaneous with 3-0 Dexon and skin was then closed with  <START:treatment>  staples  <END>  . 

Attention was then directed to the second metatarsal .  <START:problem>  A linear incision  <END>  was made over the dorsal aspect of  <START:test>  the second metatarsal head and neck region  <END>  .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was deepened . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried down to the periosteal structures .  <START:problem>  Incision  <END>  was made through the periosteum medial to the extensor tendon apparatus . Capsular structures reflected  <START:test>  medial and laterally , exposing the head and neck of the second metatarsal  <END>  . Standard dorsal distal to plantar  <START:treatment>  proximal osteotomy  <END>  was performed . Once completed , the capital fragment was shifted proximally reducing the overall length . It was then held in placed with  <START:treatment>  a bone clamp  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  FRS  <END>  screw was utilized to  <START:treatment>  compress  <END>  and hold the osteotomy stable . The area was copiously flushed . Capsular structures were then closed with 3-0 Dexon and skin was closed with 4-0 nylon . 

Attention was then directed to the fourth and fifth toes .  <START:problem>  A longitudinal incision  <END>  was made over the dorsolateral aspect of the fourth toe . The skin and soft tissue were reflected laterally . Capsular structure was then incised following  <START:problem>  the initial skin incision  <END>  , and the capsular structures were reflected as they envelope laterally and  <START:problem>  slightly dorsomedially  <END>  , exposing the lateral half of the head of the proximal phalanx , shaft of the proximal phalanx and middle phalanx of the fourth toe . Sagittal saw was introduced and  <START:problem>  the head on the lateral aspect  <END>  was cut and removed from the surgical site .  <START:problem>  The middle phalanx lateral half  <END>  was cut and removed from the surgical site . The remaining areas were then made smooth with  <START:treatment>  a rotary bur  <END>  . The area was copiously flushed . Capsular structure was closed with 4-0 Dexon and skin was then closed with 4-0 nylon . 

Attention was then directed to the fifth toe .  <START:problem>  Two converging semi-elliptical incisions  <END>  were made over the corn / callus formation on the medial aspect of the distal interphalangeal joint .  <START:treatment>  Incisions  <END>  were deepened and enclosed piece of  <START:treatment>  skin  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  corn  <END>  / callus formation were excised from the surgical site . Sharp and blunt dissection was carried over the distal interphalangeal joint .  <START:treatment>  A rotary bur  <END>  was introduced and the bony spurs noted on the medial aspect of the distal phalanx and on the middle phalanx were remodeled and removed with  <START:treatment>  rotary bur  <END>  . The areas were made smooth with rotary bur , copiously flushed and then standard closure of the skin and capsular structures with 4-0 nylon was accomplished . 

At this time ,  <START:treatment>  Marcaine  <END>  was introduced into  <START:treatment>  all surgical sites  <END>  for  <START:treatment>  a long postoperative anesthesia  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Decadron  <END>  was then inserted into the joints of the distal interphalangeal joint of the fifth toe of left foot , into the proximal interphalangeal joint of the fourth toe of left foot . It was injected into the second metatarsophalangeal joint and injected into the first metatarsophalangeal joint and around  <START:problem>  the Akin osteotomy site  <END>  and  <START:treatment>  first metatarsal osteotomy  <END>  site to reduce  <START:problem>  postoperative inflammation  <END>  and reduce  <START:problem>  postoperative swelling  <END>  .  <START:treatment>  Betadine  <END>  ointment  <START:treatment>  compressive dressing  <END>  was applied .  <START:treatment>  Tourniquet  <END>  was released .  <START:treatment>  CFT  <END>  was normal to all 5 digits on the left foot . After  <START:treatment>  the surgery  <END>  , prior to bandaging ,  <START:treatment>  the foot  <END>  was loaded , range of motion was tested , alignment was checked and we had a good overall appearance .  <START:test>  The extensor brevis tendon  <END>  was cut prior to closure on the first ray to prevent  <START:problem>  abductory pull  <END>  , and  <START:test>  overall cosmetic alignment  <END>  was excellent .  <START:problem>  Fluoroscan pictures  <END>  looked good and the patient tolerated the pro
